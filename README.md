# 🤖 Why ZenML?

🤹 Are you an ML engineer or data scientist shipping models to production and juggling a plethora of tools? ZenML is here to help transition your production ML pipelines to production.

![The long journey from experimentation to production.](docs/book/assets/1-pipeline-hard-reproduce.png)

Everyone loves to train ML models, but few talks about shipping them into production, and even fewer can do it well. At ZenML, we believe the journey from model development to production doesn't need to be long and painful.

If you come from unstructured notebooks or scripts with lots of manual processes, ZenML will make the path to production easier and faster for you and your team. Using ZenML allows you to own the entire pipeline - from experimentation to production.

Read more [here](https://blog.zenml.io/why-zenml/).


# 💡 What is ZenML?

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/book/assets/stack.gif">
</div>


ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines. It's built for Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers to collaborate as they develop to production. 

ZenML offers a simple and flexible syntax, is cloud- and tool-agnostic, and has interfaces/abstractions catered toward ML workflows. 
With ZenML you'll have all your favorite tools in one place, so you can tailor a workflow that caters to your specific needs.

Read more on all tools you can readily use in the [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) section. Can't find your tool? You can always [write your own integration](https://docs.zenml.io/advanced-guide/stacks/custom-flavors) to use it with ZenML.

# 🤸 Getting Started

## 💾 Installation
**Option 1** - Install ZenML via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/):

```bash
pip install zenml
```
> **Note** - ZenML supports Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.

In order to get access to the dashboard locally, install the optional dependencies for the ZenML server:

```shell
pip install "zenml[server]"
```

**Option 2** - If you’re feeling adventurous, try out the bleeding-edge installation:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git@develop --upgrade
```

> **Warning** - Fire dragons ahead. Proceed at your own risk!

**Option 3** - Install via a Docker image hosted publicly on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml):

```shell
docker run -it zenmldocker/zenml /bin/bash
```

or just run the ZenML server directly with Docker:

```shell
docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 zenmldocker/zenml-server
```

Read full installation instructions in the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation).

## 🏇 First run

If you're here for the first time, we recommend running:

```shell
zenml go
```

This spins up a Jupyter notebook that walks you through various functionalities of ZenML at a high level.

By the end, you'll get a glimpse of how to use ZenML to register a stack:

```shell
# Register a MLflow experiment tracker
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow

# Register an Airflow orchestrator
zenml orchestrator register airflow_orchestrator --flavor=airflow

# Create a stack from the components
zenml stack register airflow_stack -o airflow_orchestrator -a default -e mlflow_tracker
```

And run a simple pipeline on Airflow (or an orchestrator of your choice) creating steps like this:

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.base import ClassifierMixin
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from zenml.client import Client

experiment_tracker = Client().active_stack.experiment_tracker

@step(experiment_tracker=experiment_tracker.name)
def svc_trainer_mlflow(
    X_train: pd.DataFrame,
    y_train: pd.Series,
) -> ClassifierMixin:
    """Train a sklearn SVC classifier and log to MLflow."""
    mlflow.sklearn.autolog()  # log all model hparams and metrics to MLflow
    model = SVC(gamma=0.01)
    model.fit(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())
    train_acc = model.score(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())
    print(f"Train accuracy: {train_acc}")
    return model
```

You can also run your first pipeline right in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/notebooks/quickstart.ipynb)

## 👭 Collaborate with ZenML

ZenML is built to support teams working together. 
The underlying infrastructure on which your ML workflows run can be shared, as can the data, assets, and artifacts in your workflow. 

To visually see this in action, ZenML ships with a fully-featured dashboard, that can be launched locally with the simple command:

```
zenml up
```

![ZenML Dashboard](docs/book/assets/getting_started/zenml-up.gif)

The dashboard can also be deployed with a server on any cloud service (see Deploy ZenML section).


## 🍰 ZenBytes

New to MLOps? Get up to speed by visiting the [ZenBytes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) repo.

>ZenBytes is a series of short practical MLOps lessons taught using ZenML. 
>It covers many of the [core concepts](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts) widely used in ZenML and MLOps in general.

## 📜 ZenML Projects

Already comfortable with ZenML and wish to elevate your pipeline into production mode? Check out [ZenML Projects](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects).

>ZenML Projects is a collection of production-grade ML use-cases powered by ZenML. They are fully fleshed out, end-to-end projects that showcase ZenML's capabilities. They can also serve as a template from which to start similar projects.


# ☁️ Infrastructure Requirements

## 🔋 Deploy ZenML

While ZenML works perfectly fine locally, it should be deployed on the cloud to enable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.

The easiest and fastest way to get running on the cloud is by using the `deploy` CLI command. It currently only supports deploying to Kubernetes on managed cloud services. Read more about the command [here](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml).

```shell
zenml deploy
```

Naturally, [the docs](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml) contain detailed guides on how to manually set up ZenML on the cloud in case more control is required.

The following architectural diagram illustrates a common ZenML deployment:

![ZenML Architecture Diagram.](docs/book/assets/getting_started/Scenario3.2.png)

## 👨‍🍳 Open Source MLOps Stack Recipes

Apart from the infrastructure required to run ZenML itself, ZenML also boasts a ton of [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) into popular MLOps tools. The [ZenML Stack](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/stacks/stacks) concept ensures that these tools work nicely together, therefore bringing structure and standardization into the MLOps workflow.

However, ZenML assumes that the stack infrastructure for these tools is already provisioned. If you do not have deployed infrastructure, and want to quickly spin up combinations of tools on the cloud, the [MLOps stack sister repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks) contains a series of Terraform-based recipes to provision such stacks. These recipes can be used directly with ZenML:

```bash
zenml stack recipe deploy <NAME_OF_STACK_RECIPE> --import
```

The above command not only provisions the given tools, but also automatically creates a ZenML stack with the configuration of the deployed recipe!


# 🗺 Roadmap

ZenML is being built in public. The [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) is a
regularly updated source of truth for the ZenML community to understand where
the product is going in the short, medium, and long term.

ZenML is managed by a [core team](https://zenml.io/company#CompanyTeam) of developers that are
responsible for making key decisions and incorporating feedback from the
community. The team oversees feedback via various channels, and you can directly
influence the roadmap as follows:

- Vote on your most wanted feature on our [Discussion
  board](https://zenml.io/discussion).
- Start a thread in our [Slack channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite).
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues/new/choose) on our Github repo.
