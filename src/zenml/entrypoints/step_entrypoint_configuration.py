class StepEntrypointConfiguration(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for entrypoint configurations that run a single step.

    If an orchestrator needs to run steps in a separate process or environment
    (e.g. a docker container), you should create a custom entrypoint
    configuration class that inherits from this class and use it to implement
    your custom entrypoint logic.

    How to subclass:
    ----------------
    There is only one mandatory method `get_run_name(...)` that you need to
    implement in order to get a functioning entrypoint. Inside this method you
    need to return a string which **has** to be the same for all steps that are
    executed as part of the same pipeline run.

    Passing additional arguments to the entrypoint:
        If you need to pass additional arguments to the entrypoint, there are
        two methods that you need to implement:
            * `get_custom_entrypoint_options()`: This method should return all
                the additional options that you require in the entrypoint.

            * `get_custom_entrypoint_arguments(...)`: This method should return
                a list of arguments that should be passed to the entrypoint.
                The arguments need to provide values for all options defined
                in the `custom_entrypoint_options()` method mentioned above.

        You'll be able to access the argument values from `self.entrypoint_args`
        inside your `StepEntrypointConfiguration` subclass.

    Running custom code inside the entrypoint:
        If you need to run custom code in the entrypoint, you can overwrite
        the `setup(...)` and `post_run(...)` methods which allow you to run
        code before and after the step execution respectively.

    How to use:
    -----------
    After you created your `StepEntrypointConfiguration` subclass, you only
    have to run the entrypoint somewhere. To do this, you should execute the
    command returned by the `get_entrypoint_command()` method with the
    arguments returned by the `get_entrypoint_arguments(...)` method.

    Example:
    ```python
    class MyStepEntrypointConfiguration(StepEntrypointConfiguration):
        ...

    class MyOrchestrator(BaseOrchestrator):
        def prepare_or_run_pipeline(
            self,
            sorted_list_of_steps: List[BaseStep],
            pipeline: "BasePipeline",
            pb2_pipeline: Pb2Pipeline,
            stack: "Stack",
            runtime_configuration: "RuntimeConfiguration",
        ) -> Any:
            ...

            cmd = MyStepEntrypointConfiguration.get_entrypoint_command()
            for step in sorted_list_of_steps:
                ...

                args = MyStepEntrypointConfiguration.get_entrypoint_arguments(
                    step=step, pb2_pipeline=pb2_pipeline
                )
                # Run the command and pass it the arguments. Our example
                # orchestrator here executes the entrypoint in a separate
                # process, but in a real-world scenario you would probably run
                # it inside a docker container or a different environment.
                import subprocess
                subprocess.check_call(cmd + args)
