"""Initialization for the post-execution module.

After executing a pipeline, the user needs to be able to fetch it from history
and perform certain tasks. The post_execution submodule provides a set of
interfaces with which the user can interact with artifacts, the pipeline, steps,
and the post-run pipeline object.
