# üèãÔ∏è Track your runs with Neptune

[Neptune](https://neptune.ai/product/experiment-tracking) is a
popular platform that you would normally use in the iterative ML experimentation
phase to track and visualize experiment results. Neptune can also
track and visualize the results produced by your
automated pipeline runs, as you make the transition towards a more production
oriented workflow.

## üó∫ Overview
This example showcases how to use the Neptune Experiment Tracker flavor to log and visualize information from your pipeline steps (e.g. models, parameters, metrics).

We'll be using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset and
will train a classifier using [Tensorflow (Keras)](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
We will run two experiments with different parameters (epochs and learning rate)
and log these experiments into a neptune platform. 

In the example script, the [neptune-tensorflow-keras](https://docs.neptune.ai/integrations/keras/) is
used within the training step to directly hook into the TensorFlow training.  
It will log out all relevant parameters, metrics and output files Automatically. . Additionally, we explicitly log the test accuracy within the evaluation step.

Note that despite `neptune` being used in different steps within a pipeline, ZenML handles initializing `neptune` and ensures the experiment name is the same as the pipeline name, and the experiment run is the same name as the pipeline run name. This establishes a lineage between pipelines in ZenML and experiments in `neptune`.

# üñ• Run it locally

### üìÑ Prerequisites 

### Set up a free Neptune account
To get this example running, you need to set up a Neptune account. You can do this for free [here](https://app.neptune.ai/register).

### Pre-requisites
In order to run this example, you need to install and initialize ZenML:

```shell
# install CLI
pip install "zenml[server]"

# install ZenML integrations
zenml integration install tensorflow neptune
pip install neptune-client[tensorflow-keras]

# pull example
zenml example pull neptune_tracking
cd zenml_examples/neptune_tracking

# initialize
zenml init

# Start the ZenServer to enable dashboard access
zenml up
```

### ü•û Create the stack with the Neptune experiment tracker component

In order to use an experiment tracking tool like Neptune, you need to create a new `StackComponent`,  and 
subsequently a new `Stack` with the type `neptune`. The Neptune tracker stack component has the following options:

* `api_token`: [API key token](https://docs.neptune.ai/setup/setting_api_token) of your Neptune account. If left blank, Neptune will
attempt to retrieve it from your environment variables.
* `project`: The name of the project where you're sending the new run, in the form "workspace-name/project-name".
If the project is not specified, Neptune will attempt to retrieve it from your environment variables.

Note that project_name and entity are optional in the below command:

```shell
zenml experiment-tracker register neptune_experiment_tracker --flavor=neptune \ 
    --project=<project_name> --api_token=<token>

zenml stack register neptune_stack \
    -a default \
    -o default \
    -e neptune_experiment_tracker \
    --set
```

### ‚ñ∂ Run the project
Now we're ready. Execute:

```shell
python run.py
```

### üîÆ See results
The results should be available at the URL: https://app.neptune.ai/{ACCOUNT_USERNAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}

Each pipeline run will be logged as a separate experiment run in Neptune. You can see the results of the pipeline run in the Neptune UI.

For example, here are the runs 'raw:

![Chart Results](assets/neptune_runs.png)


For each run, you should see the following visualizations:

![Charts Results](assets/neptune_charts.png)

![Monitoring Results](assets/neptune_monitoring.png)

### Using `neptune.Settings`

You can pass a set of tags to the Neptune run by using the `NeptuneExperimentTrackerSettings` class, like in the example
below:

```python
import numpy as np

import tensorflow as tf

from zenml.steps import step
from zenml.integrations.neptune.experiment_trackers.run_state import (
    get_neptune_run,
)
from zenml.integrations.neptune.flavors import NeptuneExperimentTrackerSettings

neptune_settings = NeptuneExperimentTrackerSettings(tags={"keras", "mnist"})

@step(
    experiment_tracker="<NEPTUNE_TRACKER_STACK_COMPONENT_NAME>",
    settings={
        "experiment_tracker.neptune": neptune_settings
    }
)
def my_step(
        x_test: np.ndarray,
        y_test: np.ndarray,
        model: tf.keras.Model,
) -> float:
    """Log metadata to Neptune run"""
    neptune_run = get_neptune_run()
    ...
```

### üßΩ Clean up
In order to clean up, delete the remaining ZenML references:

```shell
rm -rf zenml_examples
```
