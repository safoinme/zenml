# 🏃 Run pipelines in production using Kubeflow Pipelines

When developing ML models, you probably develop your pipelines on your local
machine initially as this allows for quicker iteration and debugging. However,
at a certain point when you are finished with its design, you might want to 
transition to a more production-ready setting and deploy the pipeline to a more
robust environment.

You can also watch a video of this example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TXRYkdL3w).

# 🖥 Run it locally

## ⏩ SuperQuick `kubeflow` run

If you're really in a hurry and just want to see this example pipeline run
without wanting to fiddle around with all the individual installation and
configuration steps, just run the following:

```shell
zenml example run kubeflow_pipelines_orchestration
```


## 👣 Step-by-Step
### 📄 Prerequisites
In order to run this example, we have to install a few tools that allow ZenML to
spin up a local Kubeflow Pipelines 
setup:

* [K3D](https://k3d.io/v5.2.1/#installation) to spin up a local Kubernetes
cluster
* The Kubernetes command-line tool [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
to deploy Kubeflow Pipelines
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to build docker images that run
your pipeline in Kubernetes pods (**Note**: the local Kubeflow Pipelines
deployment requires more than 2 GB of RAM, so if you're using Docker Desktop
make sure to update the resource limits in the preferences)


Next, we will install ZenML, get the code for this example and initialize a
ZenML repository:

```bash
# Install python dependencies
pip install "zenml[server]"
pip install notebook  # if you want to run the example on the notebook

# Install ZenML integrations
zenml integration install kubeflow tensorflow tensorboard

# Pull the kubeflow example
zenml example pull kubeflow_pipelines_orchestration
cd zenml_examples/kubeflow_pipelines_orchestration

# Initialize a ZenML repository
zenml init

# Start the ZenServer to enable dashboard access
zenml up
```

## 📓 Use the notebook 
As an alternate to running the below commands, you can also simply use the notebook version and see the story unfold there:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

Otherwise, please continue reading if you want to run it straight in Python scripts.

## 🏃 Run the pipeline **without** kubeflow pipelines

We can now run the pipeline by simply executing the python script:

```bash
python run.py
```

The script will run the pipeline locally and will start a TensorBoard
server that can be accessed to visualize the information for the trained model.

Re-running the example with different hyperparameter values will re-train
the model and the TensorBoard server will be updated automatically to include
the new model information, e.g.:

```shell
python run.py --lr=0.02
python run.py --epochs=10
```

![TensorBoard 02](assets/tensorboard-02.png)
![TensorBoard 03](assets/tensorboard-03.png)

### 🧽 Clean up

Once you're done experimenting, you can stop the TensorBoard server running
in the background by running the command below. However, you may want to keep
it running if you want to continue on to the next step and run the same
pipeline on a local Kubeflow Pipelines deployment.

```bash
python run.py --stop-tensorboard
```

## 🏃️ Run the same pipeline on a local Kubeflow Pipelines deployment

### 🥞 Create a local Kubeflow Pipelines Stack

Now with all the installation and initialization out of the way, all that's left
to do is configuring our ZenML [stack](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts). For
this example, the stack we create consists of the following four parts:
* The **local artifact store** stores step outputs on your hard disk. 
* The **local metadata store** stores metadata like the pipeline name and step
parameters inside a local SQLite database.
* The docker images that are created to run your pipeline are stored in a local
docker **container registry**.
* The **Kubeflow orchestrator** is responsible for running your ZenML pipeline
in Kubeflow Pipelines.

```bash
# Make sure to create the local registry on port 5000 for it to work 
zenml container-registry register local_registry --flavor=default --uri=localhost:5000 
zenml orchestrator register local_kubeflow_orchestrator --flavor=kubeflow
zenml stack register local_kubeflow_stack \
    -a default \
    -o local_kubeflow_orchestrator \
    -c local_registry \
    --set
```

### 🏁 Start up Kubeflow Pipelines locally

ZenML takes care of setting up and configuring the local Kubeflow Pipelines
deployment. All we need to do is run:

```bash
zenml stack up
```

When the setup is finished, you should see a local URL which you can access in
your browser and take a look at the Kubeflow Pipelines UI.

### ▶️ Run the pipeline
We can now run the pipeline by simply executing the python script:

```bash
python run.py
```

This will build a docker image containing all the necessary python packages and
files, push it to the local container registry and schedule a pipeline run in
Kubeflow Pipelines. Once the script is finished, you should be able to see the
pipeline run [here](http://localhost:8080/#/runs).

The TensorBoard logs for the model trained in every pipeline run can be viewed
directly in the Kubeflow Pipelines UI by clicking on the "Visualization" tab
and then clicking on the "Open TensorBoard" button.

![TensorBoard Kubeflow Visualization](assets/tensorboard-kubeflow-vis.png)
![TensorBoard Kubeflow UI](assets/tensorboard-kubeflow-ui.png)

At the same time, the script will start a local TensorBoard server that can be
accessed to visualize the information for all past and future versions of the
trained model.

Re-running the example with different hyperparameter values will re-train
the model and the TensorBoard server will be updated automatically to include
the new model information, e.g.:

```shell
python run.py --learning_rate=0.02
python run.py --epochs=10
```

### 🧽 Clean up
Once you're done experimenting, you can stop the TensorBoard server running
in the background with the command:

```bash
python run.py --stop-tensorboard
```

You can delete the local Kubernetes cluster and all associated resources by
calling:

```bash
zenml stack down --force
```

## ☁️ Run the same pipeline on Kubeflow Pipelines deployed to GCP

We will now run the same pipeline in Kubeflow Pipelines deployed to a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. 
As you can see from the long list of additional pre-requisites, this requires lots of external setup steps at the 
moment. In future releases ZenML will be able to automate most of these steps for you, so make sure to revisit this 
guide if this is something you're interested in!

### 📄 Additional pre-requisites

* An existing [GCP container registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs).
* An existing [GCP bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).
* [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/distributions/gke/deploy/overview/) deployed to a Google 
Kubernetes Engine cluster.
* The local docker client has to be [authorized](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication) 
to access the GCP container registry.
* Kubectl can [access](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl) your GCP 
Kubernetes cluster.

### 🚅 That seems like a lot of infrastructure work. Is there a Zen 🧘 way to run this example?

Yes! With [ZenML Stack Recipes](../../docs/book/stack-deployment-guide/stack-recipes.md), you can now provision all the infrastructure you need to run your ZenML pipelines with just a few simple commands.

The flow to get started for this example can be the following:

1. Pull the `gcp-kubeflow-kserve` recipe to your local system. Learn more about what this recipe does from its README.

    ```shell
    zenml stack recipe pull gcp-kubeflow-kserve
    ```
2. (Optional) 🎨 Customize your deployment by editing the default values in the `locals.tf` file.

3. 🚀 Deploy the recipe with this simple command.

    ```shell
    zenml stack recipe deploy gcp-kubeflow-kserve
    ```
    > **Note**
    > This command can also automatically import the resources created as a ZenML stack for you. Just run it with the `--import` flag and optionally provide a `--stack-name` and you're set! Keep in mind, in that case, you'll need all integrations for this example installed before you run this command.

    > **Note**
    > You should also have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your local system with the local [docker client authorized](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/configure-docker) to push to your cloud registry.
    
4. You'll notice that a ZenML stack configuration file gets created 🤯! You can run the following command to import the resources as a ZenML stack, manually.

    ```shell
    zenml stack import <STACK_NAME> -f <PATH_TO_THE_CREATED_STACK_CONFIG_YAML>

    # set the imported stack as the active stack
    zenml stack set <STACK_NAME>
    ```

5. You should now create a secret for the CloudSQL instance that will allow ZenML to connect to it. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    zenml secrets-manager secret register gcp_mysql_secret --schema=mysql --user=<DB_USER> --password=<PWD> \
      --ssl_ca=@</PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/SERVER-CERT> \
      --ssl_cert=@</PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/CLIENT-CERT> \
      --ssl_key=@</PATH/TO/DOWNLOADED/CLIENT-KEY>
    ```

    The values for the username and password can be obtained by running the following commands inside your recipe directory.

    ```bash
    terraform output metadata-db-username

    terraform output metadata-db-password
    ```

    For the certificates, visit the Google Cloud Console to [create a certificate and download the files](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ssl-instance#:~:text=Cloud%20SQL%20Instances-,To%20open%20the%20Overview%20page%20of%20an%20instance%2C%20click%20the,Click%20Create%20client%20certificate.) to your system.


You can now jump straight to the [section on running the pipeline](#e296b6efb88f-run-the-pipeline-1)!

### 🥞 Create a GCP Kubeflow Pipelines stack

To run our pipeline on Kubeflow Pipelines deployed to GCP, we will create a new stack with these components:
* The **artifact store** stores step outputs in a GCP Bucket. 
* The **metadata store** stores metadata inside the Kubeflow Pipelines internal MySQL database.
* The docker images that are created to run your pipeline are stored in GCP **container registry**.
* The **Kubeflow orchestrator** is responsible for running your ZenML pipeline in Kubeflow Pipelines. 
  We need to configure it with the right kubernetes context so ZenML can run pipelines in your GCP cluster. 

When running the upcoming commands, make sure to replace `<PATH_TO_YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>` and 
`<PATH_TO_YOUR_GCP_BUCKET>` with the actual URIs of your container registry and bucket. You will also need to replace
`<NAME_OF_GCP_KUBERNETES_CONTEXT>` with the kubernetes context pointing to your gcp cluster.

```bash
# In order to create the GCP artifact store, we need to install one additional ZenML integration:
zenml integration install gcp

# Create and activate the stack and its components
zenml container-registry register gcr_registry --flavor=gcp --uri=<PATH_TO_YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>
zenml artifact-store register gcp_artifact_store --flavor=gcp --path=<PATH_TO_YOUR_GCP_BUCKET>
zenml orchestrator register gcp_kubeflow_orchestrator --flavor=kubeflow --kubernetes_context=<NAME_OF_GCP_KUBERNETES_CONTEXT>
zenml stack register gcp_kubeflow_stack \
    -a gcp_artifact_store \
    -o gcp_kubeflow_orchestrator \
    -c gcr_registry \
    --set

# Forward the Kubeflow pipelines UI and metadata store so we can access them locally
zenml stack up
```

### ▶️ Run the pipeline

Configuring and activating the new stack is all that's necessary to switch from running your pipelines locally 
to running them on GCP:

```bash
python run.py
```

That's it! If everything went as planned this pipeline should now be running in the cloud, and we are one step 
closer to a production pipeline!

### 💻 Specifying per-step resources

If you're using the Kubeflow orchestrator and some of your pipelines steps have certain
hardware requirements, you can specify them using the step decorator as follows:

```python
from zenml.steps import step, ResourceConfiguration

@step(resource_configuration=ResourceConfiguration(cpu_count=8, memory="16GB"))
def my_step(...) -> ...:
    ...
```

This will make sure that your step runs on a machine with the specified resources as long
as such a machine is available in the Kubernetes cluster you're using.

### 🧽 Clean up
Once you're done experimenting, you can stop the port forwarding and delete the example files by calling:

```bash
zenml stack down --force
rm -rf zenml_examples
```

# ⚠️ Important note for multi-tenant Kubeflow deployments

Kubeflow has a notion of [multi-tenancy](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/overview/) 
built into its deployment. Kubeflow’s multi-user isolation simplifies user 
operations because each user only views and edits the Kubeflow components 
and model artifacts defined in their configuration.

Using a multi-tenant deployment of Kubeflow involves a bit more configuration than is shown in this example.
For details, refer to the [Kubeflow stack component docs](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/orchestrators/kubeflow).
