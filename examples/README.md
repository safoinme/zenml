# üßë‚Äçüíª ZenML Examples

Here you can find a list of practical examples on how you can use ZenML
integrations with
brief descriptions for each example. In case you run into any open questions
while interacting with our examples, feel free
to check our [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/).

The examples contain aspects that span across the whole range of tools and
concepts that are integral to the MLOps
ecosystem.

## üóÇ Feature Stores

What is data-centric machine learning without data? Feature stores are the
modern approach to
advanced data management layer for machine learning that allows to share and
discover features for creating more effective
machine learning pipelines.

- **[feast_feature_store](feast_feature_store/README.md)**: Use a feature store
  hosted on a local Redis server to
  get started with [Feast](https://feast.dev/)

## üìä Data Visualizers

Within ZenML, visualizers are Python classes that take post-execution view
objects (e.g. `PipelineView`,
`PipelineRunView`, `StepView`, etc.) and create visualizations for them.

- **[facets_visualize_statistics](facets_visualize_statistics/README.md)**:
  The [facets](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/) integration allows you to
  retroactively go through pipeline runs and
  analyze the statistics of the data artifacts.
- **[whylogs_data_profiling](whylogs_data_profiling/README.md)**: Profile your
  data using the
  [whylogs](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs) integration from within the
  post-execution workflow.
- **[evidently_drift_detection](evidently_drift_detection/README.md)**: Detect
  drift with our
  [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) integration.

## üß™ Experiment Tracking

Certain phases of machine learning projects require a large amount of
experimentation with many possible approaches.
Experiment tracking is vital to capture and compare all your experiments so that
you can narrow down your solution
space.

- **[mlflow_tracking](mlflow_tracking/README.md)**: Track and visualize
  experiment runs with
  [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html).
- **[wandb_tracking](wandb_tracking/README.md)**: Track and visualize experiment
  runs with
  [Wandb Experiment Tracking](https://wandb.ai/site/experiment-tracking).

## üöÄ Model Deployment

What good are your models if no-one gets to interact with them? ZenML offers you
some easy ways to quickly deploy your
model.

- **[mlflow_deployment](mlflow_deployment/README.md)**: Deploys your trained
  models to a **local** MLflow deployment
  service and allows you to run predictions against this endpoint.
- **[seldon_core_deployment](seldon_deployment/README.md)**: Take your model
  deployment to the next level
  with Seldon. This example gives you detailed instructions to help you deploy
  your model onto a Kubernetes cluster.

## üöÖ Pipeline Orchestration

Quickly iterating is usually easiest when you code on your local machine. But
there comes a point where
you will want to have your pipelines run free from all the limitations of your
local setup (performance, data access,
uptime, etc ...). With ZenML you can quickly switch out the pipeline code
orchestrator using the CLI. Here are some
examples on how:

- **[airflow_orchestration](airflow_orchestration/README.md)**: Running
  pipelines with Airflow locally.
- **[kubeflow_pipeline_orchestration](kubeflow_pipeline_orchestration/README.md)**:
  Shows how to orchestrate a pipeline
  using a local Kubeflow stack.

## ü•æ Step Operators

Not all steps are created equal. While some steps need only a bit of
computational power, the training step is usually
a different beast altogether, with a big appetite for CUDA cores and VRAM. This
is where Step Operators will make your
life easy. With just a bit of configuration your training step can easily be run
on Vertex AI, Sagemaker or AzureML.
Check out our example to see how.

- **[step_operator_remote_training](step_operator_remote_training/README.md)**:
  Run your compute-intensive steps on one
  of the big three hyperscalers **Vertex AI**, **Sagemaker** or **AzureML**.

## üîë Secret Managers

The need for a central place to manage credentials, keys and passwords cannot be
understated. Our examples show you how to access your secrets within steps of 
your pipeline.

- **[aws_secret_manager](aws_secret_manager/README.md)** Access your secrets
  manager from within a step using AWS's secrets manager.
- *COMING SOON*: **[google_secret_manager](google_secret_manager/README.md)**
  Access your secrets
  manager from within a step using Google's secrets manager.

## üóø Miscellaneous Tools

Some of our integrations don't really fit into a specific category.

- **[huggingface](huggingface/README.md)**: [`Hugging Face`](https://huggingface.co/)
  is a startup in the Natural
  Language Processing (NLP) domain offering its library of SOTA models in
  particular around Transformers. See how you can
  get started using huggingface datasets, models and tokenizers with ZenML.
- **[neural_prophet](neural_prophet/README.md)**: NeuralProphet is a time-series
  model that bridges the gap between
  traditional time-series models and deep learning methods. Try this example to
  find out how this type of model
  can be trained using ZenML
- **[xgboost](xgboost/README.md)**: [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  is an optimized distributed
  gradient boosting library that provides a parallel tree boosting algorithms.
- **[lightgbm](lightgbm/README.md)**: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework
  that uses tree-based learning
  algorithms with a focus on distributed, efficient training.

## üñ• Local Setup

For some of these examples, ZenML provides a handy CLI command to pull them
directly into your local environment. First install `zenml`:

```shell
pip install zenml
```

Then you can view all the examples:

```shell
zenml example list
```

And pull individual ones:

```shell
zenml example pull EXAMPLE_NAME
# at this point a `zenml_examples` dir would be created with the examples
```

You can now even run the example directly with a one-liner:

```shell
zenml example run EXAMPLE_NAME  # not implemented for all examples
```
