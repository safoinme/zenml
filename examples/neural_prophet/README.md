# üîÆ Predicting the future with NeuralProphet

[NeuralProphet](https://github.com/ourownstory/neural_prophet) is a Neural 
Network based Time-Series model, inspired by [Facebook Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) 
and [AR-Net](https://github.com/ourownstory/AR-Net), built on PyTorch. 
NeuralProphet bridges the gap between traditional time-series models and deep 
learning methods.

This example showcases how to train a `NeuralProphet` model in a ZenML pipeline.
The ZenML `NeuralProphet` integration includes a custom materializer that 
persists the trained `NeuralProphet` model to and from the artifact store. 
Here, we utilize this materializer to train a model to predict the electricity 
consumption of a hospital.

The data used in this example is available 
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ourownstory/neural_prophet/blob/main/tutorials/application-example/energy_hospital_load.ipynb#scrollTo=0VKninwPyGl9)
and the pipeline is loosely based on this 
[guide](https://neuralprophet.com/notebooks/energy_hospital_load.html) 
from the NeuralProphet documentation.

## üñ• Run it locally

## ‚è© SuperQuick `neural prophet` run

If you're really in a hurry and just want to see this example pipeline run
without wanting to fiddle around with all the individual installation and
configuration steps, just run the following:

```shell
zenml example run neural_prophet
```

## üë£ Step-by-Step

### üìÑ Prerequisites

In order to run this example, you need to install and initialize ZenML:

```shell
# install CLI
pip install "zenml[server]"

# install ZenML integrations
zenml integration install neural_prophet

# pull example
zenml example pull neural_prophet
cd zenml_examples/neural_prophet

# Initialize ZenML repo
zenml init

# Start the ZenServer to enable dashboard access
zenml up
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

Now we're ready. Execute:

```shell
python run.py
```

Alternatively, if you want to run based on the config.yaml you can run with:

```bash
zenml pipeline run pipelines/neural_prophet_pipeline/neural_prophet_pipeline.py -c config.yaml
```

After running the pipeline, you may inspect the accompanying notebook to visualize results:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

### üßΩ Clean up

In order to clean up, delete the remaining ZenML references.

```shell
rm -rf zenml_examples
```
