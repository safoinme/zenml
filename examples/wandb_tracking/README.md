# üèãÔ∏è Integrating Weights & Biases tracking into your pipeline

[Weights&Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/experiment-tracking) is a popular
tool that tracks and visualizes experiment runs with their many parameters,
metrics and output files.

## üó∫ Overview
This example showcases how easily Weights & Biases (`wandb`) tracking can be integrated into a ZenML pipeline.

We'll be using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset and
will train a classifier using [Tensorflow (Keras)](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
We will run two experiments with different parameters (epochs and learning rate)
and log these experiments into a wandb backend. 

In the example script, the [Keras WandbCallback](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/integrations/keras/wandbcallback) is
used within the training step to directly hook into the TensorFlow training.  
It will log out all relevant parameters, metrics and output files. Additionally,
we explicitly log the test accuracy within the evaluation step.

Note that despite `wandb `being used in different steps within a pipeline, ZenML handles initializing `wandb` 
and ensures the experiment name is the same as the pipeline name, and the experiment run is the same name 
as the pipeline run name. This establishes a lineage between pipelines in ZenML and experiments in `wandb`.

# üñ• Run it locally

### üìÑ Prerequisites 

### Set up a free Weights & Biases account
To get this example running, you need to set up a Weights & Biases account. You can do this for free [here](https://wandb.ai/login?signup=true).

### Pre-requisites
In order to run this example, you need to install and initialize ZenML:

```shell
# install CLI
pip install zenml

# install ZenML integrations
zenml integration install tensorflow wandb -y

# pull example
zenml example pull wandb_tracking
cd zenml_examples/wandb_tracking

# initialize
zenml init
```

### ü•û Create the stack with the wandb experiment tracker component

In order to use an experiment tracking tool like Weights & Biases, you need to create a new `StackCoomponent`,  and 
subsequently a new `Stack` with the type `wandb`. The wandb experiment tracker stack component has the following options:

- `api_key`: Non-optional API key token of your wandb account.
- `project_name`: The name of the project where you're sending the new run. If the project is not specified, the run is put in an "Uncategorized" project.
- `entity`: An entity is a username or team name where you're sending runs. This entity must exist before you can send runs there, so make sure to create your account or team in the UI before starting to log runs. If you don't specify an entity, the run will be sent to your default entity, which is usually your username. 

Note that project_name and entity are optional in the below command:

```shell
zenml experiment-tracker register wandb_tracker --type=wandb \
    --api_key=<WANDB_API_KEY> \
    --entity=<WANDB_ENTITY> \
    --project_name=<WANDB_PROJECT_NAME>

zenml stack register wandb_stack \
    -m default \
    -a default \
    -o default \
    -e wandb_tracker
    
# Activate the newly created stack
zenml stack set wandb_stack
```

### ‚ñ∂ Run the project
Now we're ready. Execute:

```shell
python run.py
```

### üîÆ See results
The results should be available at the URL: https://wandb.ai/{ENTITY_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}/runs/

Every step should yield an additional wandb run in the UI. The naming convention of each run is `{pipeline_run_name}_{step_name}` (e.g. `wandb_example_pipeline-25_Apr_22-20_06_33_535737_tf_evaluator`)

Each run in wandb will be tagged with two things: `pipeline_name` and `pipeline_run_name`, which the user can use to group together and filter. 

For example, here are the runs 'raw' and ungrouped:

![Chart Results](assets/wandb_runs_ungrouped.png)

Here is the view where we filter for all runs within just the pipeline we ran:

![Chart Results](assets/wandb_grouped.png)

For each run, you should see the following visualizations:

![Table Results](assets/wandb_table_results.png)

![Chart Results](assets/wandb_charts_results.png)

### Using `wandb.Settings`

ZenML allows you to override the [wandb.Settings](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/sdk/wandb_settings.py#L353) 
class in the `enable_wandb` decorator to allow for even further control of the wandb integration. One feature that is super useful 
is to enable `magic=True`, like so:

```python
import wandb


@enable_wandb(wandb.Settings(magic=True))
@step
def my_step(
        x_test: np.ndarray,
        y_test: np.ndarray,
        model: tf.keras.Model,
) -> float:
    """Everything in this step is autologged"""
    ...
```

Doing the above auto-magically logs all the data, metrics, and results within the step, no further action required!

### üßΩ Clean up
In order to clean up, delete the remaining ZenML references:

```shell
rm -rf zenml_examples
```
