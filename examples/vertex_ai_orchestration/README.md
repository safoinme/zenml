# üèÉ Run pipelines in production using Vertex AI

[Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction)
is a serverless ML workflow tool running on the Google Cloud Platform. It is
an easy way to quickly run your code in a production-ready, repeatable 
cloud orchestrator that requires minimal setup without provisioning and paying 
for standby compute. 

## üìÑ Pre-requisites

In order to run on Vertex AI you will need to do quite a bit of configuration
within GCP to create all the required resources. In total, you will need to 
have:

- [GCP container registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs)
- [GCP bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets)
- [CloudSQL database](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-instance)
- [GCP Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager).

Additionally, the [Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/?hl=en_GB&_ga=2.241201409.-205697788.1651483076)
needs to be enabled.

On top of having these resources, you will also need to do some permission
tuning.

First, you will need to authenticate yourself using the
[gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login):

```shell
gcloud auth login
```

Then you will need to
[authorize](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication)
your local Docker client to have access the GCP container registry.

```shell
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

You will also need to 
[create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

This service account will need permissions to run Vertex AI jobs, and access 
secrets as Admin. Additionally, your user account will need to have permissions 
to use the service account.

## ü•û Create a GCP Kubeflow Pipelines stack

Before registering the stack, you need to deploy a remote ZenML server 
on GCP. See the [deployment guide](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml) 
for more information.

Once everything is done on the GCP side, we will need to configure a
stack with all of these components.

* The **artifact store** to store step outputs in a GCP Bucket.
* The Docker images that are created to run your pipeline are stored in GCP
  **container registry**.
* The **Vertex orchestrator** is responsible for running your ZenML pipeline
  in Vertex AI.
* The **secrets manager** contains the secrets to allow access across Vertex AI.

When running the upcoming commands, make sure to
replace all the <PLACEHOLDERS> with the correct values from your GCP project.

```bash
# install CLI
pip install "zenml[server]"

# install ZenML integrations
zenml integration install gcp

# pull example
zenml example pull vertex_ai_orchestration
cd zenml_examples/vertex_ai_orchestration

# Create a zenml repository
zenml init

# In order to create the GCP stack components, we'll need to install one 
# additional ZenML integration:
zenml integration install gcp

# The CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI will have a format like this: eu.gcr.io/xxx/xxx
zenml container-registry register gcp_registry --flavor=gcp --uri=<CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI>

# The PATH_TO_YOUR_GCP_BUCKET is the path to your GCP bucket: gs://xxx
zenml artifact-store register gcp_artifact_store --flavor=gcp --path=<PATH_TO_YOUR_GCP_BUCKET>

# The orchestrator needs the PROJECT_ID and the GCP_LOCATION in which to
#  run the Vertex AI pipeline. Additionally you might need to set the 
#  WORKLOAD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT to the service account you created with secret
#  manager access, it will be in the format: xxx@xxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com
zenml orchestrator register vertex_orch --flavor=vertex --project=<PROJECT_ID> --location=<GCP_LOCATION>

# For the secrets manager, all we'll need it the gcp PROJECT_ID
zenml secrets-manager register gcp_secrets_manager --flavor=gcp --project_id=<PROJECT_ID>

# Now we're ready to assemble our stack
zenml stack register gcp_vertex_stack -a gcp_artifact_store -o vertex_orch -c gcp_registry -x gcp_secrets_manager --set
```

Your stack should look something like this when you're done:

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the pipeline

Once your stack is fully set up, you should be good to go. 

```bash
python run.py
```

That's it! If everything went as planned this pipeline should now be running in
the cloud! You should be able to access the Vertex AI Pipelines UI with the link
returned to the run logs. It will look something like this:

### üíª Specifying per-step resources

If you're using the Vertex orchestrator and some of your pipelines steps have 
certain hardware requirements, you can specify them using the step decorator as 
follows:

```python
from zenml.steps import step, ResourceSettings

@step(settings={"resources": ResourceSettings(cpu_count=8, memory="16GB")})
def my_step(...) -> ...:
    ...
```

### üßΩ Clean up

Once you're done experimenting, you can stop the port forwarding and delete the
example files by calling:

```bash
zenml stack down --force
rm -rf zenml_examples
```

Additionally, you might have to clean up your cloud resources to avoid running 
costs for storage of artifacts, containers, metadata or secrets.
