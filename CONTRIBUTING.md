# üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing to ZenML

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to ZenML! It‚Äôs people like you that make it a reality for users
in our community.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone
involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the developers' time management and develop these open
source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping
you finalize your pull requests.

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high communication standards.
By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## üõ´ Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please get in touch with [support@zenml.io](mailto:support@zenml.io), monitored by
  our security team.
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to make sure issues are handled on time, but it could take a while to investigate the root cause depending on the impact.

A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw
  attention if your issue is blocking.

The best way to start is to check
the [`good-first-issue` label](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/labels/good%20first%20issue) on the issue board. These
The core team creates these issues as necessary smaller tasks that you can work on to get deeper into ZenML internals.

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before
a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and
providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses your problem, please add your own reproduction information to the
existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding
a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be
indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### üè∑ Pull Requests

PRs to ZenML are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In
general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or in your Pull Request.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open
an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Review and sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/zenml-io/zenml) (CLA).
2. Fork the repository to your own Github account
3. Clone the project to your machine
4. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
5. Commit changes to the branch
6. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
7. Push changes to your fork
8. Open a PR in our repository (to the `develop` branch, **NOT** `main`) and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

### üßê Linting, formatting, and tests

ZenML is mainly developed using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependency management system. In order to
install all core dev-dependencies, do:

```
poetry install
```

Optionally, you might want to run the following commands to ensure you have all integrations for `mypy` checks:

```
zenml integration install -f
mypy --install-types
```

Warning: This might take a while for both (~ 15 mins each), however if you have time, please run it as it will make the
next commands error-free.

It is easy to run the following scripts via poetry to ensure code formatting and linting is in order:

```
poetry run bash scripts/format.sh
poetry run bash scripts/lint.sh
poetry run bash scripts/check-spelling.sh
```

Tests can be run as follows:

```
poetry run bash scripts/test-coverage-xml.sh
```

Please note that it is good practice to run the above commands before submitting any Pull Request: The CI GitHub Action
will run it anyway, so might as well catch the errors locally.

### üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an
email to: support@zenml.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to
reproduce the security issue.

We will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

Please refrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability as this could potentially put our users at
risk! It's better to discuss privately and give us a chance to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact
as much as possible.
