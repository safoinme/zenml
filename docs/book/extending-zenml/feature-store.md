description: Managing of your data/features.

Feature stores allow data teams to serve data via an offline store, and an 
online low-latency store where data is kept in sync between the two. It also 
offers a centralized registry where features (and feature schemas) are stored 
for use within a team or wider organization.

**Base abstraction in progress!**

We are actively working on the base abstraction for the feature stores, which 
will be available soon. As a result, their extension is not possible at the 
moment. If you would like to use a feature store in your stack, please check 
the list of already available feature stores down below.

## List of available feature stores

For production use cases, some more flavors can be found in specific 
`integrations` modules. In terms of features stores, ZenML features an 
integration of `feast`.
