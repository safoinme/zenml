description: Orchestrating the run of pipelines
---

The orchestrator is one of the most critical components of your stack, as it
defines where the actual pipeline job runs. It controls how and where each
individual step within a pipeline is executed. Therefore, the orchestrator can
be used to great effect to scale jobs into production.

concept of [stacks, stack components and their flavors](./stacks-components-flavors.md).

## Base Implementation

ZenML aims to enable orchestration with any orchestration tool. This is where
the `BaseOrchestrator` comes into play. It abstracts away many of the ZenML 
specific details from the actual implementation and exposes a simplified 
interface:

1. As it is the base class for a specific type of `StackComponent`,
   it inherits from the `StackComponent` class. This sets the `TYPE`
   variable to the specific `StackComponentType`.
2. The `FLAVOR` class variable needs to be set in the particular sub-class as it
   is meant to identify the implementation flavor of the particular
   orchestrator.
3. Lastly, the base class features one `abstractmethod`:
   `prepare_or_run_pipeline`. In the implementation of every
   `Orchestrator` flavor, it is required to define this method with respect
   to the flavor at hand.

Putting all these considerations together, we end up with the following
(simplified) implementation:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import ClassVar, List, Any

from tfx.proto.orchestration.pipeline_pb2 import Pipeline as Pb2Pipeline

from zenml.enums import StackComponentType
from zenml.stack import StackComponent
from zenml.steps import BaseStep


class BaseOrchestrator(StackComponent, ABC):
    """Base class for all ZenML orchestrators"""

    # --- Class variables ---
    TYPE: ClassVar[StackComponentType] = StackComponentType.ORCHESTRATOR

    @abstractmethod
    def prepare_or_run_pipeline(
            self,
            sorted_steps: List[BaseStep],
            pipeline: "BasePipeline",
            pb2_pipeline: Pb2Pipeline,
            stack: "Stack",
            runtime_configuration: "RuntimeConfiguration",
    ) -> Any:
        """Prepares and runs the pipeline outright or returns an intermediate
        pipeline representation that gets deployed.
        """
```

## List of available orchestrators

Out of the box, ZenML comes with a `LocalOrchestrator` implementation, which
is a simple implementation for running your pipelines locally.

Moreover, additional orchestrators can be found in specific `integrations`
modules, such as the `AirflowOrchestrator` in the `airflow` integration and the
`KubeflowOrchestrator` in the `kubeflow` integration.

If you would like to see the available flavors for artifact stores, you can
use the command:

```shell
zenml orchestrator flavor list
```

## Build your own custom orchestrator

If you want to create your own custom flavor for an artifact store, you can
follow the following steps:

1. Create a class which inherits from the `BaseOrchestrator`.
2. Define the `FLAVOR` class variable.
3. Implement the `prepare_or_run_pipeline()` based on your desired orchestrator.

Once you are done with the implementation, you can register it through the CLI
as:

```shell
zenml orchestrator flavor register <THE-SOURCE-PATH-OF-YOUR-ORCHESTRATOR>
```

# Some additional implementation details

Not all orchestrators are created equal. Here is a few basic categories that
differentiate them.

## Direct Orchestration

The implementation of a `local` orchestrator can be summarized in two lines of
code:

```python
for step in sorted_steps:
    self.run_step(...)
```

The orchestrator basically iterates through each step and directly executes
the step within the same Python process. Obviously all kind of additional
configuration could be added around this.

## Python Operator based Orchestration

The `airflow` orchestrator has a slightly more complex implementation of the
`prepare_or_run_pipeline()` method. Instead of immediately
executing a step, a `PythonOperator` is created which contains a
`_step_callable`. This `_step_callable` will ultimately execute the
`self.run_step(...)` method of the orchestrator. The PythonOperators are
assembled into an AirflowDag which is returned. Through some Airflow magic,
this DAG is loaded by the connected instance of Airflow and orchestration of
this DAG is performed either directly or on a set schedule.

## Container-based Orchestration

The `kubeflow` orchestrator is a great example of container-based orchestration.
In an implementation-specific method called `prepare_pipeline_deployment()`
a Docker image containing the complete project context is built.

Within `prepare_or_run_pipeline()` a yaml file is created as an intermediate
representation of the pipeline and uploaded to the Kubeflow instance.
To create this yaml file a callable is defined within which a `dsl.ContainerOp`
is created for each step. This ContainerOp contains the container entrypoint
command and arguments that will make the image run just the one step.
The ContainerOps are assembled according to their interdependencies inside a
`dsl.Pipeline` which can then be compiled into the yaml file.

## Base Implementation of the Step Entrypoint Configuration

Within the base Docker images that are used for container-based orchestration
the `src.zenml.entrypoints.step_entrypoint.py` is the default entrypoint to run
a specific step. It does so by loading an orchestrator specific
`StepEntrypointConfiguration` object. This object is then used to parse all
entrypoint arguments (e.g. --step_source <relative-path-to-step>). Finally, the
`StepEntrypointConfiguration.run()` method is used to execute the step.
Under the hood this will eventually also call the orchestrators `run_step()`
method.

The `StepEntrypointConfiguration` is the base class that already implements
most of the required functionality. Let's dive right into it:

1. The `DEFAULT_SINGLE_STEP_CONTAINER_ENTRYPOINT_COMMAND` is the default
   entrypoint command for the Docker container.
2. Some arguments are mandatory for the step entrypoint. These are set as
   constants at the top of the file and used as the minimum required arguments.
3. The `run()` method uses the parsed arguments to set up all required
   prerequisites before ultimately executing the step.

Here is a schematic view of what the `StepEntrypointConfiguration` looks like:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, List, Set

from zenml.steps import BaseStep

DEFAULT_SINGLE_STEP_CONTAINER_ENTRYPOINT_COMMAND = [
    "python",
    "-m",
    "zenml.entrypoints.step_entrypoint",
]
# Constants for all the ZenML default entrypoint options
ENTRYPOINT_CONFIG_SOURCE_OPTION = "entrypoint_config_source"
PIPELINE_JSON_OPTION = "pipeline_json"
MAIN_MODULE_SOURCE_OPTION = "main_module_source"
STEP_SOURCE_OPTION = "step_source"
INPUT_SPEC_OPTION = "input_spec"


class StepEntrypointConfiguration(ABC):

    # --- This has to be implemented by the subclass ---
    @abstractmethod
    def get_run_name(self, pipeline_name: str) -> str:
        """Returns the run name."""
        
    # --- These can be implemented by subclasses ---
    @classmethod
    def get_custom_entrypoint_options(cls) -> Set[str]:
        """Custom options for this entrypoint configuration"""
        return set()

    @classmethod
    def get_custom_entrypoint_arguments(
            cls, step: BaseStep, **kwargs: Any
    ) -> List[str]:
        """Custom arguments the entrypoint command should be called with."""
        return []

    # --- This will ultimately be called by the step entrypoint ---

    def run(self) -> None:
       """Prepares execution and runs the step that is specified by the 
       passed arguments"""
       ...
```

## Build your own Step Entrypoint Configuration

There is only one mandatory method `get_run_name(...)` that you need to
implement in order to get a functioning entrypoint. Inside this method you
need to return a string which **has** to be the same for all steps that are
executed as part of the same pipeline run.

If you need to pass additional arguments to the entrypoint, there are
two methods that you need to implement:

* `get_custom_entrypoint_options()`: This method should return all the
  additional options that you require in the entrypoint.

* `get_custom_entrypoint_arguments(...)`: This method should return a list of
  arguments that should be passed to the entrypoint. The arguments need to
  provide
  values for all options defined in the `custom_entrypoint_options()` method
  mentioned above.
