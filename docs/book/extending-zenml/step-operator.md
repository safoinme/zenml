description: Running individual steps in specialized environments.

Step operators allow you to run individual steps in a custom environment
different from the default one used by your active orchestrator. One example
use-case is to run a training step of your pipeline in an environment with GPUs
available.

Before reading this chapter, make sure that you are familiar with the 
concept of [stacks, stack components and their flavors](./stacks-components-flavors.md).

## Base Abstraction

The `BaseStepOperator` is the abstract base class that needs to be subclassed 
in order to run specific steps of your pipeline in a separate environment. As 
step operators can come in many shapes and forms, the base class exposes a 
deliberately simple and generic interface:

1. As it is the base class for a specific type of `StackComponent`,
   it inherits from the `StackComponent` class. This sets the `TYPE`
   variable to the specific `StackComponentType`.
2. The `FLAVOR` class variable needs to be set in subclasses as it
   is meant to identify the implementation flavor of the particular
   step operator.
3. Lastly, the base class features one `abstractmethod` called `launch()`. In 
   the implementation of every step operator flavor, the `launch()` method is 
   responsible for preparing the environment and executing the step.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import ClassVar, List

from zenml.enums import StackComponentType
from zenml.stack import StackComponent


class BaseStepOperator(StackComponent, ABC):
    """Base class for all ZenML step operators."""

    # Class Configuration
    TYPE: ClassVar[StackComponentType] = StackComponentType.STEP_OPERATOR

    @abstractmethod
    def launch(
        self,
        pipeline_name: str,
        run_name: str,
        requirements: List[str],
        entrypoint_command: List[str],
    ) -> None:
        """Abstract method to execute a step.

        Concrete step operator subclasses must implement the following
        functionality in this method:
        - Prepare the execution environment and install all the necessary
          `requirements`
        - Launch a **synchronous** job that executes the `entrypoint_command`
        """
```

This is a slimmed-down version of the base implementation which aims to 
highlight the abstraction layer. In order to see the full implementation 
and get the complete docstrings, please check the [API docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/0.7.3/api_docs/step_operators/#zenml.step_operators.base_step_operator.BaseStepOperator).

## List of available step operators

You can find step operator implementations for the three big cloud providers in 
the `azureml`, `sagemaker` and `vertex` integrations.

If you would like to see the available flavors for step operators, you can 
use the command:

```shell
zenml step-operator flavor list
```

## Building your own custom step operator

If you want to create a custom step operator, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a class which inherits from the `BaseStepOperator`.
2. Define the `FLAVOR` class variable.
3. Implement the abstract `launch()` method. This method has two main 
   responsibilities:
      * Preparing a suitable execution environment (e.g. a Docker image): The 
   general environment is highly dependent on the concrete step operator 
   implementation, but for ZenML to be able to run the step it requires you to 
   install some `pip` dependencies. The list of requirements needed to 
   successfully execute the step is passed in via the `requirements` argument of 
   the `launch()` method. Additionally, you'll have to make sure that all the 
   source code of your ZenML step and pipeline are available within this 
   execution environment.
      * Running the entrypoint command: Actually running a single step of a 
   pipeline requires knowledge of many ZenML internals and is implemented in 
   the `zenml.step_operators.entrypoint` module. As long as your environment 
   was set up correctly (see the previous bullet point), you can run the step 
   using the command provided via the `entrypoint_command` argument of the 
   `launch()` method.

Once you are done with the implementation, you can register it through the CLI 
as:

```shell
zenml step-operator flavor register <SOURCE-PATH-OF-YOUR-STEP-OPERATOR-CLASS>
```
