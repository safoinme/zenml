# Skip materialization

While in most cases, [materializers](../../developer-guide/materializer.md) should
be used to control
how artifacts are consumed and output from steps in a pipeline, you will
sometimes
need to have a completely non-materialized artifact in a step.

A non-materialized artifact is a `BaseArtifact` (or any of its subclasses) and
has a property `uri` that points
to the unique path in the [artifact store](../../introduction/core-concepts.md)
where the
artifact is stored. One can use a non-materialized artifact by simply specifying
it as the type in
the step:

```python
from zenml.artifacts import DataArtifact
from zenml.steps import step


@step
def my_step(my_artifact: DataArtifact)  # rather than pd.DataFrame
    pass
```

The list of raw artifact types can be found in `zenml.artifacts.*` and
include `ModelArtifact`, `DataArtifact` etc.
Materializers link pythonic types to these artifact types implicitly, e.g.,
a `keras.model` or `torch.nn.Module` are pythonic
types that are both linked to `ModelArtifact` implicitly via their
materializers. When using artifacts directly, one must
be aware of which type they are by looking at the previous step's materializer:
if the previous step produces a
`ModelArtifact` then you should specify `ModelArtifact` in a non-materialized
step.

Be careful: Using artifacts directly like this might have unintended
consequences for downstream
tasks that rely on materialized artifacts.

## A simple example

A simple example can suffice to showcase how to use non-materialized artifacts:

```python
from typing import Dict, List
from zenml.artifacts import DataArtifact, ModelArtifact
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline
from zenml.steps import Output, step


@step
def step_1() -> Output(dict_=Dict, list_=List):
    return {"some": "data"}, []


@step
def step_2() -> Output(dict_=Dict, list_=List):
    return {"some": "data"}, []


@step
def step_3(dict_: Dict, list_: List) -> None:
    assert type(dict_) is dict
    assert type(list_) is list


@step
def step_4(dict_: DataArtifact, list_: ModelArtifact) -> None:
    assert hasattr(dict_, "uri")
    assert hasattr(list_, "uri")


@pipeline
def p(s1, s2, s3, s4):
    s3(*s1())
    s4(*s2())


p(step_1(), step_2(), step_3(), step_4()).run()
```

In the above the pipeline looks as follows:

```shell
s1 -> s3 
s2 -> s4
```

`s1` and `s2` produce identical artifacts, however `s3` consumes materialized
artifacts
while `s4` consumes non-materialized artifacts. `s4` can now use the `dict_.uri`
and `list_.uri` paths directly rather than their materialized counterparts.
