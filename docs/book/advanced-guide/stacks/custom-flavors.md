description: How to write a custom stack component flavor
---

When building sophisticated ML workflows, you will often need to come up with
custom-tailored solutions. Sometimes, this might even require you to use custom 
components for your infrastructure or tooling.

That is exactly why the stack component flavors in ZenML are designed to be
modular and straightforward to extend. Using ZenML's base abstractions, you can
create your own stack component flavor and use it in your stack.

## Base Abstractions

Before we get into the topic of creating custom stack component flavors, let us
briefly discuss some of the important design choices behind the abstraction of a 
ZenML flavor. The overall implementation revolves around 
three base interfaces, namely the `StackComponent`, the `StackComponentConfig`, 
and the `Flavor`.

### Base Abstraction 1: `StackComponent` 

The `StackComponent` is utilized as an interface to define the logic behind 
the functionality of a flavor. For instance, you can take a look at the 
`BaseArtifactStore` example down below. By inheriting from the `StackComponent`,
the `BaseArtifactStore` establishes the interface for all artifact stores. 
Any flavor of an artifact store needs to follows the standards set by this 
base class.

```python
class StackComponent:
    """Abstract StackComponent class for all components of a ZenML stack."""


class BaseArtifactStore(StackComponent):
    """Base class for all ZenML artifact stores."""
    
    # --- public interface ---
    
    @abstractmethod
    def open(self, name: PathType, mode: str = "r") -> Any:
        """Open a file at the given path."""

    @abstractmethod
    def exists(self, path: PathType) -> bool:
        """Checks if a path exists."""

    ...
```

### Base Abstraction 2: `StackComponentConfig`

As its name suggests, the `StackComponentConfig` is used to configure a 
stack component instance. It is separated from the actual implementation on 
purpose. This way, ZenML can use this class to validate the configuration of a 
stack component during its registration/update, without having to import heavy 
(or even non-installed) dependencies. Let us continue with the same example 
up above and take a look at the `BaseArtifactStoreConfig`.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class StackComponentConfig(BaseModel):
    """Base class for all ZenML stack component configs."""


class BaseArtifactStoreConfig(StackComponentConfig):
    """Config class for `BaseArtifactStore`."""

    path: str

    SUPPORTED_SCHEMES: ClassVar[Set[str]]

    @root_validator(skip_on_failure=True)
    def _ensure_artifact_store(cls, values: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
        """Validator function for the Artifact Stores.

        Checks whether supported schemes are defined and the given path is
        supported.
        """
        ...
```

There are a few things to unpack here. Let's talk about Pydantic first. Pydantic
is a library for [data validation and settings management](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/). 
By using their `BaseModel` as a base class, ZenML is able to configure and 
serialize these configuration properties while being able to add a validation 
layer to each implementation.

If you take a closer look at the example above, you will see that, 
through the `BaseArtifacStoreConfig`, each artifact store will require users 
to define a `path` variable along with a list of `SUPPORTED_SCHEMES`. Using 
this configuration class, ZenML can check if the given `path` is actually 
supported.

{% hint style="info" %}
Similar to the example above, you can use class variables by denoting them 
with the `ClassVar[..]`, which are also excluded from the serialization.
{% endhint %}

### Base Abstraction 3: `Flavor`

Ultimately, the `Flavor` abstraction is responsible for bringing the
implementation of a `StackComponent` together with the corresponding 
`StackComponentConfig` definition to create a `Flavor`.

```python
class Flavor:
    """Base class for ZenML Flavors."""

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str:
        """The name of the flavor."""

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def type(self) -> StackComponentType:
        """The type of the flavor."""

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def implementation_class(self) -> Type[StackComponent]:
        """Implementation class for this flavor."""

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def config_class(self) -> Type[StackComponentConfig]:
        """Configuration class for this flavor."""


class BaseArtifactStoreFlavor(Flavor):
    """Base class for artifact store flavors."""

    @property
    def type(self) -> StackComponentType:
        """Returns the flavor type."""
        return StackComponentType.ARTIFACT_STORE

    @property
    def config_class(self) -> Type[StackComponentConfig]:
        """Config class for this flavor."""
        return BaseArtifactStoreConfig
```

Following the same example, the `BaseArtifactStoreFlavor` sets the correct 
`type` property and introduces the `BaseArtifactStoreConfig` as the default 
configuration for all ZenML artifact stores.


## Implementing a Custom Stack Component Flavor

Using all the abstraction layers above, let us create a custom artifact store
flavor, starting with the configuration.

```python
from zenml.artifact_stores import BaseArtifactStoreConfig


class MyArtifactStoreConfig(BaseArtifactStoreConfig):
    """Custom artifact store implementation."""
    
    my_param: int  # Adding a custom parameter on top of the `path` variable
```

With the configuration defined, we can move on to the logic behind the 
implementation:

```python
from zenml.artifact_stores import BaseArtifactStore


class MyArtifactStore(BaseArtifactStore):
    """Custom artifact store implementation."""
    
    def open(self, name: PathType, mode: str = "r") -> Any:
        """Custom logic goes here."""
        ...
    
    def exists(self, path: PathType) -> bool:
        """Custom logic goes here."""
        ...
    
    def my_custom_method(self):
        """Custom method here."""
        print(self.config.path)     # The configuration properties are available 
        print(self.config.my_param) # under self.config
```

Now, let us bring these two classes together through a `Flavor`. Make sure 
that you give your flavor a unique name here. 

```python
from zenml.artifact_stores import BaseArtifactStoreFlavor


class MyArtifactStoreFlavor(BaseArtifactStoreFlavor):
    """Custom artifact store implementation."""
    
    def name(self) -> str:
        """The name of the flavor."""
        return 'my_artifact_store'
    
    def implementation_class(self) -> Type["BaseArtifactStore"]:
        """Implementation class for this flavor."""
        from ... import MyArtifactStore
        return MyArtifactStore

    def config_class(self) -> Type[StackComponentConfig]:
        """Configuration class for this flavor."""
        from ... import MyArtifactStoreConfig
        return MyArtifactStoreConfig
```

## Managing a Custom Stack Component Flavor

Once your implementation is complete, you can register it through the CLI:

```shell
zenml artifact-store flavor register <path.to.MyArtifactStoreFlavor>
```

Afterwards, you should see the new custom artifact store flavor in the list of
available artifact store flavors:

```shell
zenml artifact-store flavor list
```

And that's it, you now have defined a custom stack component flavor that you
can use in any of your stacks just like any other flavor you used before, e.g.:

```shell
zenml artifact-store register <ARTIFACT_STORE_NAME> \
    --flavor=my_artifact_store \
    ...

zenml stack register <STACK_NAME> \
    --artifact-store <ARTIFACT_STORE_NAME> \
    --path='some-path' \
    --my_param=3 
```
