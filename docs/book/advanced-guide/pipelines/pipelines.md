description: Configure pipelines at will with ZenML.
---

The goal of this section is to showcase some critical advanced use-cases 
regarding the configuration of different ZenML resources.

## List of topics

* [Runtime Settings](./settings.md) showcases how to
configure different ZenML resource during the runtime of a pipeline.
* [Passing Custom Data Types through Steps](./materializers.md)
via **Materializers** is required if one of your steps outputs a custom class
or other data types, for which materialization is not defined by ZenML itself.
* [Specifying Hardware Resources for Steps](./step-resources.md) explains
how to specify hardware resources like memory or the amount of CPUs and GPUs that
a step requires to execute.
* [Access metadata within steps](./step-metadata.md)
via **Step Fixtures** can, for instance, be used to load the best performing
prior model to compare newly trained models against.
* [Controlling the Step Execution Order](./step-order.md) explains how
to control the order in which steps of a pipeline get executed.
