# Deploy with Docker

The ZenML server container image is available at [`zenmldocker/zenml-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml/) and can be used to deploy ZenML with a container management or orchestration tool like docker and docker-compose, or a serverless platform like [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), [Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/overview), and more! This guide walks you through the various configuration options that the ZenML server container expects as well as a few deployment use cases.

## Try it out locally first

If you're just looking for a quick way to deploy the ZenML server using a container, without going through the hassle of interacting with a container management tool like docker and manually configuring your container, you can use the ZenML CLI to do so. You only need to have Docker installed and running on your machine:

```bash
zenml up --docker
```

This command deploys a ZenML server locally in a Docker container, then connects your client to it. Similar to running plain `zenml up`, the server and the local ZenML client share the same SQLite database.

The rest of this guide is addressed to advanced users who are looking to manually deploy and manage a containerized ZenML server.

## ZenML server configuration options

If you're planning on deploying a custom containerized ZenML server yourself, you probably need to configure some settings for it like the **database** it should use, the **default user details,** and more. The ZenML server container image uses sensible defaults, so you can simply start a container without worrying too much about the configuration. However, if you're looking to connect the ZenML server to an external MySQL database or secrets management service, to persist the internal SQLite database, or simply want to control other settings like the default account, you can do so by customizing the container's environment variables.

The following environment variables can be passed to the container:

* **ZENML\_DEFAULT\_PROJECT\_NAME**: The name of the default project created by the server on the first deployment, during database initialization. Defaults to `default`.
* **ZENML\_DEFAULT\_USER\_NAME**: The name of the default admin user account created by the server on the first deployment, during database initialization. Defaults to `default`.
* **ZENML\_DEFAULT\_USER\_PASSWORD**: The password to use for the default admin user account. Defaults to an empty password value, if not set.
*   **ZENML\_STORE\_URL**: This URL should point to an SQLite database file _mounted in the container_, or to a MySQL-compatible database service _reachable from the container_. It takes one of these forms:

    ```
    sqlite:////path/to/zenml.db
    ```

    or:

    ```
    mysql://username:password@host:port/database
    ```
* **ZENML\_STORE\_SSL\_CA**: This can be set to a custom server CA certificate in use by the MySQL database service. Only valid when `ZENML_STORE_URL` points to a MySQL database that uses SSL-secured connections. The variable can be set either to the path where the certificate file is mounted inside the container or to the certificate contents themselves.
* **ZENML\_STORE\_SSL\_CERT**: This can be set to a client SSL certificate required to connect to the MySQL database service. Only valid when `ZENML_STORE_URL` points to a MySQL database that uses SSL-secured connections and requires client SSL certificates. The variable can be set either to the path where the certificate file is mounted inside the container or to the certificate contents themselves. This variable also requires `ZENML_STORE_SSL_KEY` to be set.
* **ZENML\_STORE\_SSL\_KEY**: This can be set to a client SSL private key required to connect to the MySQL database service. Only valid when `ZENML_STORE_URL` points to a MySQL database that uses SSL-secured connections and requires client SSL certificates. The variable can be set either to the path where the certificate file is mounted inside the container or to the certificate contents themselves. This variable also requires `ZENML_STORE_SSL_CERT` to be set.
* **ZENML\_STORE\_SSL\_VERIFY\_SERVER\_CERT**: This boolean variable controls whether the SSL certificate in use by the MySQL server is verified. Only valid when `ZENML_STORE_URL` points to a MySQL database that uses SSL-secured connections. Defaults to `False`.
* **ZENML\_LOGGING\_VERBOSITY**: Use this variable to control the verbosity of logs inside the container. It can be set to one of the following values: `NOTSET`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO` (default), `DEBUG` or `CRITICAL`.

If none of the `ZENML_STORE_*` variables are set, the container will default to creating and using an SQLite database file stored at `/zenml/.zenconfig/local_stores/default_zen_store/zenml.db` inside the container. The `/zenml/.zenconfig/local_stores` base path where the default SQLite database is located can optionally be overridden by setting the `ZENML_LOCAL_STORES_PATH` environment variable to point to a different path (e.g. a persistent volume or directory that is mounted from the host).

### Secret store environment variables

There are many possible Secret Stores that you can choose between. Each one of these Secret Stores requires the docker image to contain different configurations.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="MySQL" %}
The SQL database is used as the default secret store. You only need to configure these options if you want to change the default behavior.

* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_TYPE:** Set this to `sql` in order to explicitly set this type of secret store.
*   **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_ENCRYPTION\_KEY**: This is a secret key used to encrypt all secrets stored in the SQL secrets store. If not set, encryption will not be used and passwords will be stored unencrypted in the database. This should be set to a random string with a recommended length of at least 32 characters, e.g.:

    ```python
    from secrets import token_hex
    token_hex(32)
    ```

    or:

    ```shell
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```

> **Important:** If you configure encryption for your SQL database secrets store, you should keep the `ZENML_SECRETS_STORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` value somewhere safe and secure, as it will be required to decrypt the secrets in the database. If you lose the encryption key, you will not be able to decrypt the secrets in the database and will have to reset them.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="AWS" %}
These configuration options are only relevant if you're using the AWS Secrets Manager as the secrets store backend.

* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_TYPE:** Set this to `aws` in order to set this type of secret store.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_REGION\_NAME**: The AWS region to use. This must be set to the region where the AWS Secrets Manager service that you want to use is located.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID**: The AWS access key ID to use for authentication. This must be set to a valid AWS access key ID that has access to the AWS Secrets Manager service that you want to use. If you are using an IAM role attached to an EKS cluster to authenticate, you can omit this variable. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY**: The AWS secret access key to use for authentication. This must be set to a valid AWS secret access key that has access to the AWS Secrets Manager service that you want to use. If you are using an IAM role attached to an EKS cluster to authenticate, you can omit this variable. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_AWS\_SESSION\_TOKEN**: Optional AWS session token to use for authentication. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_SECRET\_LIST\_REFRESH\_TIMEOUT**: AWS' [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager) has a known issue where it does not immediately reflect new and updated secrets in the `list_secrets` results. To work around this issue, you can set this refresh timeout value to a non-zero value to get the ZenML server to wait after creating or updating an AWS secret until the changes are reflected in the secrets returned by `list_secrets` or the number of seconds specified by this value has elapsed. Defaults to `0` (disabled). Should not be set to a high value as it may cause thread starvation in the ZenML server on high load.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GCP" %}
These configuration options are only relevant if you're using the GCP Secrets Manager as the secrets store backend.

* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_TYPE:** Set this to `gcp` in order to set this type of secret store.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_PROJECT\_ID**: The GCP project ID to use. This must be set to the project ID where the GCP Secrets Manager service that you want to use is located.
* **GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS**: The path to the GCP service account credentials file to use for authentication. This must be set to a valid GCP service account credentials file that has access to the GCP Secrets Manager service that you want to use. If you are using a GCP service account attached to a GKE cluster to authenticate, you can omit this variable. NOTE: the path to the credentials file must be mounted into the container.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Azure" %}
These configuration options are only relevant if you're using Azure Key Vault as the secrets store backend.

* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_TYPE:** Set this to `azure` in order to set this type of secret store.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_KEY\_VAULT\_NAME**: The name of the Azure Key Vault. This must be set to point to the Azure Key Vault instance that you want to use.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_AZURE\_CLIENT\_ID**: The Azure application service principal client ID to use to authenticate with the Azure Key Vault API. If you are running the ZenML server hosted in Azure and are using a managed identity to access the Azure Key Vault service, you can omit this variable. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_AZURE\_CLIENT\_SECRET**: The Azure application service principal client secret to use to authenticate with the Azure Key Vault API. If you are running the ZenML server hosted in Azure and are using a managed identity to access the Azure Key Vault service, you can omit this variable. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_AZURE\_TENANT\_ID**: The Azure application service principal tenant ID to use to authenticate with the Azure Key Vault API. If you are running the ZenML server hosted in Azure and are using a managed identity to access the Azure Key Vault service, you can omit this variable. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Hashicorp" %}
These configuration options are only relevant if you're using Hashicorp Vault as the secrets store backend.

* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_TYPE:** Set this to `hashicorp` in order to set this type of secret store.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_VAULT\_ADDR**: The URL of the HashiCorp Vault server to connect to. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_VAULT\_TOKEN**: The token to use to authenticate with the HashiCorp Vault server. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_VAULT\_NAMESPACE**: The Vault Enterprise namespace. Not required for Vault OSS. NOTE: this is the same as setting the `VAULT_NAMESPACE` environment variable.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_MAX\_VERSIONS**: The maximum number of secret versions to keep for each Vault secret. If not set, the default value of 1 will be used (only the latest version will be kept).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Custom" %}
These configuration options are only relevant if you're using a custom secrets store backend implementation. For this to work, you must have [a custom implementation of the secrets store API](../../user-guide/advanced-guide/secret-management/custom-secret-stores.md) in the form of a class derived from `zenml.zen_stores.secrets_stores.base_secrets_store.BaseSecretsStore`. This class must be importable from within the ZenML server container, which means you most likely need to mount the directory containing the class into the container or build a custom container image that contains the class.

The following configuration option is required:

* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_TYPE:** Set this to `custom` in order to set this type of secret store.
* **ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_CLASS\_PATH**: The fully qualified path to the class that implements the custom secrets store API (e.g. `my_package.my_module.MySecretsStore`).

If your custom secrets store implementation requires additional configuration options, you can pass them as environment variables using the following naming convention:

* `ZENML_SECRETS_STORE_<OPTION_NAME>`: The name of the option to pass to the custom secrets store class. The option name must be in uppercase and any hyphens (`-`) must be replaced with underscores (`_`). ZenML will automatically convert the environment variable name to the corresponding option name by removing the prefix and converting the remaining characters to lowercase. For example, the environment variable `ZENML_SECRETS_STORE_MY_OPTION` will be converted to the option name `my_option` and passed to the custom secrets store class configuration.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**ZENML\_SECRETS\_STORE\_TYPE**: Set this variable to `none`to disable the secrets store functionality altogether.
{% endhint %}

### Advanced server configuration options

These configuration options are not required for most use cases, but can be useful in certain scenarios that require mirroring the same ZenML server configuration across multiple container instances (e.g. a Kubernetes deployment with multiple replicas):

*   **ZENML\_SERVER\_JWT\_SECRET\_KEY**: This is a secret key used to sign JWT tokens used for authentication. If not explicitly set, a random key is generated automatically by the server on startup and stored in the server's global configuration. This should be set to a random string with a recommended length of at least 32 characters, e.g.:

    ```python
    from secrets import token_hex
    token_hex(32)
    ```

    or:

    ```shell
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```

## Run the ZenML server with Docker

As previously mentioned, the ZenML server container image uses sensible defaults for most configuration options. This means that you can simply run the container with Docker without any additional configuration and it will work out of the box for most use cases:

```bash
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name zenml zenmldocker/zenml-server
```

> **Note:** It is recommended to use a ZenML container image version that matches the version of your client, to avoid any potential API incompatibilities (e.g. `zenmldocker/zenml-server:0.21.1` instead of `zenmldocker/zenml-server`).

The above command will start a containerized ZenML server running on your machine that uses a temporary SQLite database file stored in the container. Temporary means that the database and all its contents (stacks, pipelines, pipeline runs, etc.) will be lost when the container is removed with `docker rm`.

You can visit the ZenML dashboard at `http://localhost:8080` and login with the `default` username and empty password or connect your client to the server with the web login flow:

```shell
$ zenml connect --url http://localhost:8080
Connecting to: 'http://localhost:8080'...
If your browser did not open automatically, please open the following URL into your browser to proceed with the authentication:

http://localhost:8080/devices/verify?device_id=f7a7333a-3ef0-4f39-85a9-f190279456d3&user_code=9375f5cdfdaf36772ce981fe3ee6172c

Successfully logged in.
Creating default stack for user 'default' in workspace default...
Updated the global store configuration.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The `localhost` URL **will** work, even if you are using Docker-backed ZenML orchestrators in your stack, like [the local Docker orchestrator](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/orchestrators/local-docker.md) or [a locally deployed Kubeflow orchestrator](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/orchestrators/kubeflow.md).

ZenML makes use of specialized DNS entries such as `host.docker.internal` and `host.k3d.internal` to make the ZenML server accessible from the pipeline steps running inside other Docker containers on the same machine.
{% endhint %}

You can manage the container with the usual Docker commands:

* `docker logs zenml` to view the server logs
* `docker stop zenml` to stop the server
* `docker start zenml` to start the server again
* `docker rm zenml` to remove the container

If you are looking for a customized ZenML server Docker deployment, you can configure one or more of [the supported environment variables](deploy-with-docker.md#zenml-server-configuration-options) and then pass them to the container using the `docker run` `--env` or `--env-file` arguments (see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file) for more details). For example:

```shell
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name zenml \
    --env ZENML_STORE_URL=mysql://username:password@host:port/database \
    zenmldocker/zenml-server
```

If you're looking for a quick way to run both the ZenML server and a MySQL database with Docker, you can [deploy the ZenML server with Docker Compose](deploy-with-docker.md#zenml-server-with-docker-compose).

The rest of this guide covers various advanced use cases for running the ZenML server with Docker.

### Persisting the SQLite database

Depending on your use case, you may also want to mount a persistent volume or directory from the host into the container to store the ZenML SQLite database file. This can be done using the `--mount` flag (see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) for more details). For example:

```shell
mkdir zenml-server
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name zenml \
    --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/zenml-server,target=/zenml/.zenconfig/local_stores/default_zen_store \
    zenmldocker/zenml-server
```

This deployment has the advantage that the SQLite database file is persisted even when the container is removed with `docker rm`.

### Docker MySQL database

As a recommended alternative to the SQLite database, you can run a MySQL database service as another Docker container and connect the ZenML server container to it.

A command like the following can be run to start the containerized MySQL database service:

```shell
docker run --name mysql -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql:8.0
```

If you also wish to persist the MySQL database data, you can mount a persistent volume or directory from the host into the container using the `--mount` flag, e.g.:

```shell
mkdir mysql-data
docker run --name mysql -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
    --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/mysql-data,target=/var/lib/mysql \
    mysql:8.0
```

Configuring the ZenML server container to connect to the MySQL database is just a matter of setting the `ZENML_STORE_URL` environment variable. We use the special `host.docker.internal` DNS name that is resolved from within the Docker containers to the gateway IP address used by the Docker network (see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds-for-all-platforms) for more details). On Linux, this needs to be explicitly enabled in the `docker run` command with the `--add-host` argument:

```shell
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name zenml \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --env ZENML_STORE_URL=mysql://root:password@host.docker.internal/zenml \
    zenmldocker/zenml-server
```

Connecting your client to the ZenML server is the same as before:

```shell
zenml connect --url http://localhost:8080
```

### Direct MySQL database connection

This scenario is similar to the previous one, but instead of running a ZenML server, the client is configured to connect directly to a MySQL database running in a Docker container.

As previously covered, the containerized MySQL database service can be started with a command like the following:

```shell
docker run --name mysql -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql:8.0
```

The ZenML client on the host machine can then be configured to connect directly to the database with a slightly different `zenml connect` command:

```shell
zenml connect --url mysql://127.0.0.1/zenml --username root --password password
```

> **Note** The `localhost` hostname will not work with MySQL databases. You need to use the `127.0.0.1` IP address instead.

### ZenML server with `docker-compose`

Docker compose offers a simpler way of managing multi-container setups on your local machine, which is the case for instance if you are looking to deploy the ZenML server container and connect it to a MySQL database service also running in a Docker container.

To use Docker Compose, you need to [install the docker-compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) on your machine first.

A `docker-compose.yml` file like the one below can be used to start and manage the ZenML server container and the MySQL database service all at once:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
  zenml:
    image: zenmldocker/zenml-server
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - ZENML_STORE_URL=mysql://root:password@host.docker.internal/zenml
      - ZENML_DEFAULT_USER_NAME=admin
      - ZENML_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD=zenml
    links:
      - mysql
    depends_on:
      - mysql
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    restart: on-failure
```

Note the following:

* `ZENML_STORE_URL` is set to the special Docker `host.docker.internal` hostname to instruct the server to connect to the database over the Docker network.
* The `extra_hosts` section is needed on Linux to make the `host.docker.internal` hostname resolvable from the ZenML server container.
* This example also uses the `ZENML_DEFAULT_USER_NAME` and `ZENML_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD` environment variables to customize the default account credentials.

To start the containers, run the following command from the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located:

```shell
docker-compose -p zenml up  -d
```

or, if you need to use a different filename or path:

```shell
docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml -p zenml up -d
```

Connecting your client to the ZenML server is the same as before:

```shell
zenml connect --url http://localhost:8080 --username admin --password zenml
```

Tearing down the installation is as simple as running:

```shell
docker-compose -p zenml down
```

## Troubleshooting

You can check the logs of the container to verify if the server is up and, depending on where you have deployed it, you can also access the dashboard at a `localhost` port (if running locally) or through some other service that exposes your container to the internet.

### CLI Docker deployments

If you used the `zenml up --docker` CLI command to deploy the Docker ZenML server, you can check the logs with the command:

```shell
zenml logs -f
```

### Manual Docker deployments

If you used the `docker run` command to manually deploy the Docker ZenML server, you can check the logs with the command:

```shell
docker logs zenml -f
```

If you used the `docker compose` command to manually deploy the Docker ZenML server, you can check the logs with the command:

```shell
docker compose -p zenml logs -f
```
