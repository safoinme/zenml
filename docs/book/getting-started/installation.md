# ðŸ§™ Installation

**ZenML** is a Python package that can be installed directly via `pip`:

```shell
pip install zenml
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that ZenML currently supports **Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11**. 
Please make sure that you are using a supported Python version.
{% endhint %}

## Install with the dashboard

ZenML comes bundled with a web dashboard that lives inside
a [sister repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-dashboard). In order to get access to the dashboard **locally**,
you need to launch the [ZenML Server and Dashboard locally](/docs/book/deploying-zenml/zenml-self-hosted/zenml-self-hosted.md).
For this, you need to install the optional dependencies for the ZenML Server:

```shell
pip install "zenml[server]"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
We highly encourage you to install ZenML in a virtual environment. At ZenML, We like to
use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
or [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) to manage our Python virtual environments.
{% endhint %}

## Verifying installations

Once the installation is completed, you can check whether the installation was successful either through Bash:

```bash
zenml version
```

or through Python:

```python
import zenml

print(zenml.__version__)
```

If you would like to learn more about the current release, please visit our
[PyPi package page.](https://pypi.org/project/zenml)

## Running with Docker
