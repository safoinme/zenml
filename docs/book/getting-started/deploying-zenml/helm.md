description: Deploying ZenML in a Kubernetes cluster with Helm
---

If you wish to manually deploy and manage ZenML in a Kubernetes cluster of your
choice, ZenML also includes a Helm chart among its available deployment options.

The Helm chart is not available on a public online repository yet, but it is
included in the ZenML source code repository. You can follow this guide to
deploy ZenML in any Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

You'll need the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster.
- Optional, but recommended: a MySQL-compatible database reachable from the
Kubernetes cluster (e.g. one of the managed databases offered by Google Cloud,
AWS or Azure). A MySQL server version of 8.0 or higher is required.
- the [Kubernetes client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
already installed on your machine and configured to access your cluster.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your machine.

To gain access to the ZenML Helm chart, you'll need to clone the ZenML
repository and checkout the `main` branch, or one of the release tags:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git
# Optional: checkout a previous release tag
# git checkout 0.21.1 
# Switch to the directory that hosts the helm chart
cd src/zenml/zen_server/deploy/helm/
```

You can start by taking a look at the `values.yaml` file and familiarizing
yourself with some of the configuration settings that you can customize for your
ZenML deployment.

In addition to tools and infrastructure, you will also need to collect and
[prepare information related to your database](#collect-information-from-your-sql-database-service)
to be used for the Helm chart configuration and you may
also want to install additional [optional services in your cluster](#optional-cluster-services).

When you are ready, you can proceed to the [installation](#installation)
section.

### Collect information from your SQL database service

Using an external MySQL-compatible database service is optional, but is
recommended for production deployments. If omitted, ZenML will default to using
an embedded SQLite database, which has the following limitations:

- the SQLite database is not persisted, meaning that it will be lost if the
ZenML server pod is restarted or deleted
- the SQLite database does not scale horizontally, meaning that you will not be
able to use more than one replica at at time for the ZenML server pod

If you decide to use an external MySQL compatible database service, you will
need to collect and prepare the following information for the Helm chart
configuration:

- the hostname and port where the SQL database is reachable from the Kubernetes
cluster
- the username and password that will be used to connect to the database. It is
recommended that you create a dedicated database user for the ZenML server and
that you restrict its privileges to only access the database that will be used
by ZenML. Enforcing secure SSL connections for the user/database is also
recommended. See the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/access-control.html)
for more information on how to set up users and privileges.
- the name of the database that will be used by ZenML. The database does not
have to exist prior to the deployment (ZenML will create it on first start).
However, you need to create the database if you follow the best practice of
restricting database user privileges to only access it.
- if you plan on using SSL to secure the client database connection, you may
also need to prepare additional SSL certificates and keys:

  - the TLS CA certificate that was used to sign the server TLS certificate, if
    you're using a self-signed certificate or signed by a custom certificate
    authority that is not already trusted by default by most operating systems. 
  - the TLS client certificate and key. This is only needed if you decide to use
    client certificates for your DB connection (some managed DB services support
    this, CloudSQL is an example).

### Optional cluster services

It is common practice to install additional infrastructure-related services in
a Kubernetes cluster to support the deployment and long-term management of
applications. For example:

- an Ingress service like [nginx-ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/)
is recommended if you want to expose HTTP services to the internet. An Ingress
is required if you want to use secure HTTPS for your ZenML deployment. The
alternative is to use a LoadBalancer service to expose the ZenML service using
plain HTTP, but this is not recommended for production.
- a [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) is
recommended if you want to generate and manage TLS certificates for your ZenML
deployment. It can be used to automatically provision TLS certificates from a
certificate authority (CA) of your choice, such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
As an alternative, the ZenML Helm chart can be configured to auto-generate
self-signed or you can generate the certificates yourself and provide them to
the Helm chart, but this makes it more difficult to manage the certificates
and you need to manually renew them when they expire.

## ZenML Helm Installation

### Configure the Helm chart

To customize the Helm chart for your deployment, you should create a copy of
the `values.yaml` file located in the `src/zenml/zen_server/deploy/helm` folder
(let’s call this `custom-values.yaml`). You’ll use this as a template to
customize your configuration. Any values that you don’t override you should
simply remove from your `custom-values.yaml` file to keep it clean and
compatible with future Helm chart releases.

In most cases, you’ll need to change the following configuration values in
`custom-values.yaml`:

- default username and password values
- the database configuration, if you mean to use an external database:

    - the database URL, formatted as
    `mysql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>`
    - CA and/or client TLS certificates, if you’re using SSL to secure the
    connection to the database

- the Ingress configuration, if enabled:
    - enabling TLS
    - enabling self-signed certificates
    - configuring the hostname that will be used to access the ZenML server,
    if different from the IP address or hostname associated with the Ingress
    service installed in your cluster

> **Note**
> All the file paths that you use in your helm chart (e.g. for certificates
like `database.sslCa`) must be relative to the `src/zenml/zen_server/deploy/helm`
helm chart directory, meaning that you also have to copy these files there.

### Install the Helm chart

Once everything is configured, you can run the following command in the
`src/zenml/zen_server/deploy/helm` folder to install the Helm chart.

```
helm -n <namespace> --create-namespace install zenml-server . --values custom-values.yaml 
```

### Connect to the deployed ZenML server

The Helm chart should print out a message with the URL of the deployed ZenML
server. You can use the URL to open the ZenML UI in your browser. You can also
use the URL to connect your local ZenML client to the server. 

To connect to a ZenML server, you can either pass the configuration as command
line arguments or as a YAML file:

```bash
zenml connect --url=https://zenml.example.com:8080 --username=admin --no-verify-ssl
```

or

```bash
zenml connect --config=/path/to/zenml_server_config.yaml
```

The YAML file should have the following structure when connecting to a ZenML
server:

```yaml
url: <The URL of the ZenML server>
username: <The username to use for authentication>
password: <The password to use for authentication>
verify_ssl: |
   <Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether the
   server's TLS certificate is verified, or a string, in which case it
   must be a path to a CA certificate bundle to use or the CA bundle
   value itself>
```

Example of a ZenML server YAML configuration file:

```yaml
url: https://ac8ef63af203226194a7725ee71d85a-7635928635.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/zenml
username: admin
password: Pa$$word123
verify_ssl: |
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDETCCAfmgAwIBAgIQYUmQg2LR/pHAMZb/vQwwXjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADAT
MREwDwYDVQQDEwh6ZW5tbC1jYTAeFw0yMjA5MjYxMzI3NDhaFw0yMzA5MjYxMzI3
...
ULnzA0JkRWRnFqH6uXeJo1KAVqtxn1xf8PYxx3NlNDr9wi8KKwARf2lwm6sH4mvq
1aZ/0iYnGKCu7rLJzxeguliMf69E
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Both options can be combined, in which case the command line arguments will
override the values in the YAML file. For example, it is possible
to supply the password only as a command line argument:

```bash
zenml connect --username zenml --password='Pa@#$#word' --config=/path/to/zenml_server_config.yaml
```

To disconnect from the current ZenML server and revert to using the local
default database, use the following command:

```bash
zenml disconnect
```

## ZenML Helm Deployment Scenarios

This section covers some common Helm deployment scenarios for ZenML.

### Minimal deployment

The example below is a minimal configuration for a ZenML server deployment that
uses a temporary SQLite database and a ClusterIP service that is not exposed to
the internet:

```yaml
zenml:

  # Use your own password here
  defaultPassword: password

  ingress:
    enabled: false
```

Once deployed, you have to use port-forwarding to access the ZenML server and
to connect to it from your local machine:

```bash
kubectl -n zenml-server port-forward svc/zenml-server 8080:80
zenml connect --url=http://localhost:8080 --username=default --password password
```

This is just a simple example only fit for testing and evaluation purposes. For
production deployments, you should use an external database and an Ingress
service with TLS certificates to secure and expose the ZenML server to the
internet.

### Basic deployment with local database

This deployment use-case still uses a local database, but it exposes the
ZenML server to the internet using an Ingress service with TLS certificates
generated by cert-manager and signed by Let's Encrypt.

First, you need to install cert-manager and nginx-ingress in your Kubernetes
cluster. You can use the following commands to install them with their default
configuration:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true
helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --namespace nginx-ingress --create-namespace
```

Next, you need to create a ClusterIssuer resource that will be used by
cert-manager to generate TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: <your email address here>
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
EOF
```

Finally, you can deploy the ZenML server with the following Helm values:

```yaml
zenml:

  # Use your own password here
  defaultPassword: password

  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-staging"
    tls:
      enabled: true
      generateCerts: false
```


> **Note**
> This use-case exposes ZenML at the root URL path of the IP address or
hostname of the Ingress service. You cannot share the same Ingress hostname and
URL path for multiple applications. See the next section for a solution to this
problem.

### Shared Ingress controller

If the root URL path of your Ingress controller is already in use by another
application, you cannot use it for ZenML. This section presents three possible
solutions to this problem.

#### Use a dedicated Ingress hostname for ZenML

If you know the IP address of the load balancer in use by your Ingress
controller, you can use a service like https://nip.io/ to create a new DNS name
associated with it and expose ZenML at this new root URL path. For example, if
your Ingress controller has the IP address `192.168.10.20`, you can use a DNS
name like `zenml.192.168.10.20.nip.io` to expose ZenML at the root URL path
`https://zenml.192.168.10.20.nip.io`.

To find the IP address of your Ingress controller, you can use a command like
the following:

```bash
kubectl -n nginx-ingress get svc nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

You can deploy the ZenML server with the following Helm values:

```yaml
zenml:

  # Use your own password here
  defaultPassword: password

  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-staging"
    host: zenml.<nginx ingress IP address>.nip.io
    tls:
      enabled: true
      generateCerts: false
```

> **Note**
> This method does not work if your Ingress controller is behind a load balancer
that uses a hostname mapped to several IP addresses instead of an IP address.

#### Use a dedicated Ingress URL path for ZenML

If you cannot use a dedicated Ingress hostname for ZenML, you can use a
dedicated Ingress URL path instead. For example, you can expose ZenML at the
URL path `https://<your ingress hostname>/zenml`.

To deploy the ZenML server with a dedicated Ingress URL path, you can use the
following Helm values:

```yaml
zenml:

  # Use your own password here
  defaultPassword: password

  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-staging"
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
    path: /zenml/?(.*)
    tls:
      enabled: true
      generateCerts: false
```

> **Note**
> This method has one current limitation: the ZenML UI does not support URL
rewriting and will not work properly if you use a dedicated Ingress URL path.
You can still connect your client to the ZenML server and use it to run
pipelines as usual, but you will not be able to use the ZenML UI.

#### Use a DNS service to map a different hostname to the Ingress controller

This method requires you to configure a DNS service like AWS Route 53 or Google
Cloud DNS to map a different hostname to the Ingress controller. For example,
you can map the hostname `zenml.<subdomain>` to the Ingress controller's IP
address or hostname. Then, simply use the new hostname to expose ZenML at the
root URL path.

## Upgrading your ZenML server

To upgrade your ZenML server Helm release to a new version, follow the steps
below: 

- Pull the latest version of the Helm chart from the ZenML github repository, or
a version of your choice, e.g.:

```bash
# If you haven't cloned the ZenML repository yet
git clone https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git
# Optional: checkout an explicit release tag
# git checkout 0.21.1
git pull
# Switch to the directory that hosts the helm chart
cd src/zenml/zen_server/deploy/helm/
```
- Simply reuse the `custom-values.yaml` file that you used during the previous
installation or upgrade. If you don't have it handy, you can extract the
values from the ZenML Helm deployment using the following command:

    ```bash
    helm -n <namespace> get values zenml-server > custom-values.yaml
    ```

- Upgrade the release using your modified values file. Make sure you are in the
directory that hosts the helm chart:

    ```bash
    helm -n <namespace> upgrade zenml-server . -f custom-values.yaml
    ```

> **Info**
> It is not recommended to change the container image tags in the Helm chart to
custom values, since every Helm chart version is tested to work only with the
default image tags, but if you really want to do it, you can do so by setting
the `zenml.image.tag` and `zenml.initImage.tag` values in your `custom-values.yaml`
file to the desired ZenML version (e.g. `0.32.0`).

> **Warning**
> If you wish to downgrade a server, make sure that the version of ZenML that
you’re moving to has the same database schema. This is because reverse migration
of the schema is not supported.
