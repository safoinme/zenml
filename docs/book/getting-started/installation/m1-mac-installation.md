description: How to install ZenML on M1 Macs
---

In order to run ZenML on Macs with M1 chips, you need to install Python under 
Rosetta 2. 
This issue arises because some of ZenML's dependencies arenâ€™t fully compatible 
with the ARM64 architecture.
The following step-by-step instructions will show you how you can install Python
and ZenML under Rosetta using the
[Homebrew (`brew`)](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) package manager and 
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) Python version manager.
The tutorial will assume that you are using the default 
[ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/) terminal.

## 1. Installing Rosetta

Depending on your machine, you might already have Rosetta installed. If not,
run the following command in your terminal to install it:

```
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

## 2. Running a Terminal under Rosetta

Next, you need a way to run your terminal under rosetta so you can install the
other dependencies later.
There are two ways how you can do this.

### Option 1: Starting a Rosetta Terminal from Terminal

One option to start a Terminal under Rosetta is to execute the following command:

```
arch -x86_64 zsh -l
```

### Option 2: Adding Rosetta Terminal to your Applications

Alternatively, you can add a Rosetta Terminal to your Applications folder by 
copying your existing Terminal application from `Applications/Utilities/Terminal`, renaming the copy, and setting the
`Open using Rosetta` checkbox as shown below:

#### 1. Go to Applications/Utilities

#### 2. Find 'Terminal'

#### 3. Copy 'Terminal'
<img src="../assets/../../assets/getting_started/installation/rosetta_terminal_3.png" alt="Rosetta Terminal App Creation 3" width="50%"/>

#### 4. Rename the copy to 'Rosetta Terminal'
<img src="../assets/../../assets/getting_started/installation/rosetta_terminal_4.png" alt="Rosetta Terminal App Creation 4" width="50%"/>

#### 5. Get Info on 'Rosetta Terminal'
<img src="../assets/../../assets/getting_started/installation/rosetta_terminal_5.png" alt="Rosetta Terminal App Creation 5" width="50%"/>

#### 6. Check the 'Open using Rosetta' Checkbox

### Verifying whether you run under Rosetta

To check whether your terminal is running under Rosetta or not, use the `arch`
command:

```
arch
```

This should return `i386` if you are running under Rosetta.

### Using Rosetta Terminal in VSCode

If you are using VSCode, you can add a Rosetta terminal option by modifying
your `settings.json`. 
To do so, press `CMD + Shift + P`, search for 'Preferences: Open User Settings 
(JSON)', then add an entry into `terminal.integrated.profiles.osx` as shown
below.

```
"terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
    ...
    "rosetta": {
        "path": "arch",
        "args": ["-x86_64", "zsh", "-l"],
        "overrideName": true
    }
},
```

Optionally, you can also set Rosetta ZSH as the default terminal by setting
`terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx` accordingly:

```
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "rosetta",
```


## 3. Installing Homebrew under Rosetta

Next, we will install Homebrew under Rosetta and alias it to `brew86`.

To install Homebrew under Rosetta, use the following command:

```
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Then, create the `brew86` alias like so:

```
alias brew86="arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew"
```

## 4. Installing pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv under Rosetta

### Installing Dependencies

To install pyenv, you first need to install its dependencies:

```
brew86 install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk
```

### Installing pyenv

Then you can install pyenv under Rosetta via:

```
brew86 install pyenv
```

### Installing pyenv-virtualenv

Similarly, you can install `pyenv-virtualenv` via:

```
brew86 install pyenv-virtualenv
```

### Creating a pyenv86 Alias

Then we will again create an alias for running pyenv under Rosetta:

```
alias pyenv86="arch -x86_64 pyenv"
```

### Setting Environment Variables

Lastly, run the following lines to set the environment variables required by
pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv in your `.zshrc`:

```
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## 5. Installing Python under Rosetta with Pyenv

Now you're all set and can install the Python version of your choice via

```
pyenv86 install <PYTHON_VERSION>
```

E.g. to install the latest Python version that ZenML currently supports (3.9.14),
run:

```
pyenv86 install 3.9.14
```

## 6. Installing ZenML in a Virtual Environment

Lastly, let's install ZenML in a new virtual environment.

### Creating a Virtual Environment with pyenv-virtualenv

To create a new virtual environment called `zenml` based on Python 3.9.14, run:

```
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.14 zenml
```

### Activating a Virtual Environment with pyenv-virtualenv

You can then activate the virtual environment using

```
pyenv activate zenml
```

### Installing ZenML

Finally, you can install ZenML in the virtual environment with pip:

```
pip install zenml
# or `pip install zenml[server]` if you want the sever installed as well
```

And that's it, you have successfully installed ZenML in Python 3.9 under Rosetta.

## Known Limitations

### TensorFlow Integration
ZenML's TensorFlow integration is based on the `tensorflow` pip package, which
doesn't support M1 Macs. 
Therefore, ZenML is currently not compatible with TensorFlow on M1 Macs.

As a result, `zenml integration install tensorflow` will install an incompatible 
package, which will cause all ZenML commands to fail with error 
`83476 illegal hardware instruction`. If you encounter this error,
uninstall TensorFlow again via `zenml integration uninstall tensorflow`.

There already exist an M1-Mac-compatible TensorFlow package 
[tensorflow-macos](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-macos/) and a package
for Mac-GPU-accelerated training of TensorFlow models 
[tensorflow-metal](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-metal/), but they are
not yet integrated with ZenML. We are actively working on supporting these
packages and hope to remove this limitation soon.

### Other Tools
Many other tools and packages commonly used by data scientists and ML engineers
do not yet fully support the M1 Mac architecture either. See, e.g., this 
[list of limitations](https://github.com/neurolabusc/AppleSiliconForNeuroimaging#limitations-facing-apple-silicon).
