# ZenML: Open-source MLOps framework that integrates all your ML tools

ü§π Are you an ML engineer or data scientist shipping models to production and juggling a plethora of tools? 

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Do you struggle with versioning data, code, and models in your projects? 

üëÄ Have you had trouble replicating production pipelines and monitoring models in production?

‚úÖ If you answered yes to any of the above, ZenML is here to help with all that and more...

Everyone loves to train ML models, but few talks about shipping them into production, and even fewer can do it well.
At ZenML, we believe the journey from model development to production doesn't need to be long and painful.

With ZenML, you can concentrate on what you do best - developing ML models and not worry about infrastructure or deployment tools.

If you come from unstructured notebooks or scripts with lots of manual processes, ZenML will make the path to production easier and faster for you and your team.
Using ZenML allows you to own the entire pipeline - from experimentation to production.

**ZenML** is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready **MLOps pipelines**. 
It's built for data scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers to collaborate as they develop to production.
**ZenML** has simple, flexible syntax, is **cloud-** and 
**tool-agnostic**, and has interfaces/abstractions that are catered towards ML workflows. ZenML brings together all your favorite tools in one place so you can tailor your workflow to cater your needs.
