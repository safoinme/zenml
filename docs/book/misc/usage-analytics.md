# Usage Analytics

In order to help us better understand how the community uses **ZenML**, the pip
package reports _anonymized_ usage statistics. You can always opt-out by using
the CLI command:

```bash
zenml config analytics opt-out
```

{% hint style="warning" %} Currently, opting in and out of analytics is a global
setting applicable to all ZenML repositories within your system. {% endhint %}

## Why ZenML collects analytics <a href="motivation" id="motivation"></a>

In addition to the community at large, **ZenML** is created and maintained by a
startup based in Munich, Germany called [ZenML GmbH](https://zenml.io). We're a
team of techies that love MLOps and want to build tools that fellow developers
would love to use in their daily work. [This is us](https://zenml.io/team/), if
you want to put faces to the names!

However, in order to improve **ZenML** and understand how it is being used, we
need to use analytics to have an overview of how it is used 'in the wild'. This
not only helps us find bugs but also helps us prioritize features and commands
that might be useful in future releases. If we did not have this information,
all we really get is pip download statistics and chatting with people directly,
which while being valuable, is not enough to seriously better the tool as a
whole.

## How ZenML collects these statistics <a href="implementation" id="implementation"></a>

**ZenML** uses [`Segment`](https://segment.com) as the data aggregation library
for all our analytics. The entire code is entirely visible and can be seen at
[`zenml_analytics.py`](../../../zenml/utils/zenml_analytics.py). The main
function is the [`track`](../../../zenml/utils/zenml_analytics.py#L167) function
that triggers a
[Segment Analytics Track event](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/),
which runs on a separate background thread from the main thread.

None of the data sent can identify you individually but allows us to understand
how **ZenML** is being used holistically.

## What does ZenML collect? <a href="what" id="what"></a>

**ZenML** triggers an asynchronous
[Segment Track Event](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) on the
following events, which is also viewable in the
[`zenml_analytics.py`](../../../src/zenml/utils/analytics_utils.py) file in the
GitHub repository.

```python
# Pipelines
    RUN_PIPELINE = "Pipeline run"
    GET_PIPELINES = "Pipelines fetched"
    GET_PIPELINE = "Pipeline fetched"

    # Repo
    INITIALIZE_REPO = "ZenML initialized"

    # Profile
    INITIALIZED_PROFILE = "Profile initialized"

    # Components
    REGISTERED_STACK_COMPONENT = "Stack component registered"
    UPDATED_STACK_COMPONENT = "Stack component updated"

    # Stack
    REGISTERED_STACK = "Stack registered"
    SET_STACK = "Stack set"
    UPDATED_STACK = "Stack updated"

    # Analytics opt in and out
    OPT_IN_ANALYTICS = "Analytics opt-in"
    OPT_OUT_ANALYTICS = "Analytics opt-out"

    # Examples
    RUN_EXAMPLE = "Example run"
    PULL_EXAMPLE = "Example pull"

    # Integrations
    INSTALL_INTEGRATION = "Integration installed"
```

In addition, each Segment Track event collects the following metadata:

- A unique UUID that is anonymous.
- The **ZenML** version.
- Operating system information, e.g. Ubuntu Linux 16.04
