# Steps & Pipelines

## Step

Steps are the atomic components of a ZenML pipeline. Each step is defined by its inputs, the logic it applies and its 
outputs. Here is a very simple example of such a step:

```python
from zenml.steps import step, Output

@step
def my_first_step() -> Output(output_int=int, output_float=float):
    """Step that returns a pre-defined integer and float"""
    return 7, 0.1
```

As this step has multiple outputs, we need to use the `zenml.steps.step_output.Output` class to indicate the names 
of each output. These names can be used to directly access an output within the 
[post execution workflow](#post-execution-workflow).

Let's come up with a second step that consumes the output of our first step and performs some sort of transformation
on it. In this case, let's double the input.

```python
from zenml.steps import step, Output

@step
def my_second_step(input_int: int, input_float: float
                   ) -> Output(output_int=int, output_float=float):
    """Step that doubles the inputs"""
    return 2 * input_int, 2 * input_float
```

Now we can go ahead and create a pipeline with our two steps to make sure they work.

## Pipeline

Here we define the pipeline. This is done implementation agnostic by simply routing outputs through the 
steps within the pipeline. You can think of this as a recipe for how we want data to flow through our steps.


```python
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline

@pipeline
def first_pipeline(
    step_1,
    step_2
):
    output_1, output_2 = step_1()
    step_2(output_1, output_2)
```

### Instantiate and run your Pipeline

With your pipeline recipe in hand you can now specify which concrete step implementations are used. And with that, you
are ready to run:

```python
first_pipeline(step_1=my_first_step(), step_2=my_second_step()).run()
```

You should see the following output on your command line:

```shell
Creating run for pipeline: `first_pipeline`
Cache disabled for pipeline `first_pipeline`
Using stack `default` to run pipeline `first_pipeline`
Step `my_first_step` has started.
Step `my_first_step` has finished in 0.049s.
Step `my_second_step` has started.
Step `my_second_step` has finished in 0.067s.
Pipeline run `first_pipeline-20_Apr_22-16_07_14_577771` has finished in 0.128s.
```

You'll learn how to inspect the finished run within the chapter on our [Post Execution Workflow](#post-execution-workflow).

                   ) -> Output(output_int=int, output_float=float):

    return 2 * input_int, 2 * input_float


@pipeline
