# Installation


## Welcome

Your first step is to install **ZenML**, which comes bundled as a good old `pip` package.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that we only support Python >= 3.7 <3.9, so please adjust your Python environment accordingly.
{% endhint %}

## Virtual Environment

We highly encourage you to install **ZenML** in a virtual environment. We like
to use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to manage our Python virtual environments.

## Install with pip

When you're set with your environment, run:

```bash
pip install zenml
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re feeling brave, feel free to install the bleeding edge: **NOTE:** Do so at your own risk;
no guarantees given!

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git@develop --upgrade
```

Once the installation is completed, you can check whether the installation was successful through:

## Bash

```bash
zenml version
```

## Python

```python
import zenml
print(zenml.__version__)
```

If you would like to learn more about the current release, please visit our 
[PyPi package page.](https://pypi.org/project/zenml)

## Running with Docker

`zenml` is available as a Docker image hosted publicly on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml). Use the following command to get started in a bash environment with `zenml` available:

```
docker run -it zenmldocker/zenml /bin/bash
```
