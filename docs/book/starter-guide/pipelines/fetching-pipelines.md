# Inspecting Pipeline Runs

Once a pipeline run has completed, we can access it using the post-execution
utilities.

Each pipeline can have multiple runs associated with it, and for each run there
might be several outputs for each step. Thus, to inspect a specific output, we
first need to access the respective pipeline, then fetch the respective run, 
and then choose the step output of that specific run.

The overall hierarchy looks like this:

```shell
pipelines -> runs -> steps -> outputs

# where -> implies a 1-many relationship.
```

Let us investigate how to traverse this hierarchy level by level:

## Pipelines

ZenML keeps a collection of all created pipelines with at least one
run sorted by the time of their first run from oldest to newest.

You can either access this collection via the `get_pipelines()` method or query
a specific pipeline by name using `get_pipeline(pipeline=...)`:

```python
from zenml.post_execution import get_pipelines, get_pipeline

# get all pipelines from all stacks
pipelines = get_pipelines()

# now you can get pipelines by index
pipeline_with_latest_initial_run_time = pipelines[-1]

# or get one pipeline by name
pipeline_x = get_pipeline(pipeline="example_pipeline")

# or even use the pipeline class
pipeline_x = get_pipeline(pipeline=example_pipeline)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful when accessing pipelines by index. Even if you just ran a pipeline 
it might not be at index `-1`, due to the fact that the pipelines are sorted 
by time of *first* run. Instead, it is recommended to access the pipeline using 
the pipeline class, an instance of the class or even the name of the 
pipeline as a string: `get_pipeline(pipeline=...)`.
{% endhint %}

You can also access your pipelines through the CLI by executing the following command on the terminal:

```shell
zenml pipeline list
```

</details>

## Runs

### Getting runs from a fetched pipeline

Each pipeline can be executed many times. You can get a list of all runs using
the `runs` attribute of a pipeline.

```python
# get all runs of a pipeline chronologically ordered
runs = pipeline_x.runs 

# get the last run by index, runs are ordered by execution time in ascending order
last_run = runs[-1]

# or get a specific run by name
run = pipeline_x.get_run(run_name="my_run_name")
```

### Getting runs from a pipeline instance:

Alternatively, you can also access the runs from the pipeline class/instance
itself:

```python
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline

# Definition of pipeline
@pipeline
def example_pipeline(...):
    ...

# Instantiation and execution of pipeline
pipe = example_pipeline(...)
pipe.run()

# get all runs of the defined pipeline chronologically ordered
runs = example_pipeline.get_runs()

# get all runs of the instantiated pipeline chronologically ordered
runs = pipe.get_runs()

# get the last run by index, runs are ordered by execution time in ascending order
last_run = runs[-1]

# or get a specific run by name
run = example_pipeline.get_run(run_name=...)
```

### Directly getting a run

Finally, you can also access a run directly with the `get_run(run_name=...)`:

```python
from zenml.post_execution import get_run, get_unlisted_runs

run = get_run(run_name="my_run_name")
run = get_unlisted_runs()[-1]  # Get last unlisted run
```

<details>
<summary>Using the CLI</summary>

You can also access your runs through the CLI by executing the following command on the terminal:

```shell
zenml pipeline runs list
zenml pipeline runs list -p <MY_PIPELINE_NAME_OR_ID>
```

</details>

### Runs Configuration

Each run has a collection of useful metadata which you can access to ensure all runs 
are reproducible:

#### git_sha
The Git commit SHA that the pipeline run was performed on. This will only be set 
if the pipeline code is in a git repository and there are no uncommitted files 
when running the pipeline.
```python
commit = run.git_sha
```

#### status
The status of a pipeline run can also be found here. There are four 
possible states: failed, completed, running, cached:
```python
status = run.status
```

#### pipeline_configuration

The `pipeline_configuration` is a super object that contains all configuration of 
the pipeline and pipeline run, including 
[pipeline-level `BaseSettings`](../../advanced-guide/pipelines/settings.md), which we will learn more about later. You can also access the settings directly via the `settings` variable.

#### docstring

The docstring of the step.

## Steps

Within a given pipeline run you can now further zoom in on individual steps
using the `steps` attribute or by querying a specific step using the
`get_step(step=...)` method.

```python
# get all steps of a pipeline for a given run
steps = run.steps

# get the step that was executed first
first_step = steps[0]

# or get a specific step by name
step = run.get_step(step="first_step")
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The step `name` refers to the pipeline attribute and not the class name of the
steps that implement the step for a pipeline instance. 
{% endhint %}

```python
# Definition of pipeline
@pipeline
def example_pipeline(step_1, step_2):
    ...

# Initialize a new pipeline run
pipe = example_pipeline(step_1=first_step(), step_2=second_step())
pipe.run()

# Get the first step
pipe.get_runs()[-1].get_step(step="step_1")

# This won't work:
# pipe.get_runs()[-1].get_step(step="first_step")
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The steps are ordered by time of execution. Depending on the 
[orchestrator](../../component-gallery/orchestrators/orchestrators.md), steps can be 
run in parallel. Thus, accessing steps by index can be unreliable across 
different runs, and it is recommended to access steps by the step class,
an instance of the class or even the name of the step as a string: 
`get_step(step=...)` instead.
{% endhint %}

Similar to the run, for reproducibility, you can use the `step` object
to access:

* [`BaseParameters`](iterating.md) via `step.parameters`: The parameters used to run the step.
* [Step-level `BaseSettings`](../../advanced-guide/pipelines/settings.md)
via `step.step_configuration`
* Input and output artifacts.

## Outputs

Finally, this is how you can inspect the output of a step:
- If there only is a single output, use the `output` attribute
- If there are multiple outputs, use the `outputs` attribute, which is a
dictionary that can be indexed using the name of an output:

```python
# The outputs of a step
# if there are multiple outputs they are accessible by name
output = step.outputs["output_name"]

# if there is only one output, use the `.output` property instead 
output = step.output 

# read the value into memory
output.read()  
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The names of the outputs can be found in the `Output` typing of your steps:

```python
from zenml.steps import step, Output

@step
def some_step() -> Output(output_name=int):
    ...
```
{% endhint %}

## Code Example

Putting it all together, this is how we can access the output of the last step
of our example pipeline from the previous sections:

```python
from zenml.post_execution import get_pipeline

pipeline = get_pipeline(pipeline="first_pipeline")
last_run = pipeline.runs[-1]
last_step = last_run.steps[-1]
model = last_step.output.read()
```

or alternatively:

```python
# Definition of pipeline
@pipeline
def example_pipeline(step_1, step_2):
    ...
# Initialize a new pipeline run
pipe = example_pipeline(step_1=first_step(), step_2=second_step())
pipe.run()

# Get the first step
step_1 = pipe.get_runs()[-1].get_step(step="step_1")
output = step_1.output.read()
```

## Final note: Fetching older pipeline runs within a step

While most of this document has been focusing on the so called
post-execution workflow (i.e. fetching objects after a pipeline has
completed), it can also be used within the context of a running pipeline.

This is often desirable in cases where a pipeline is running continously
over time and decisions have to be made according to older runs.

E.g. Here, we fetch from within a step the last pipeline run for the same pipeline:

```python
from zenml.post_execution import get_pipeline
from zenml.environment import Environment

@step
def my_step():
    # Fetch the current pipeline
    p = get_pipeline('pipeline_name')

    # Fetch an older run
    older_run = p.runs[-2]  # -1 will be the current run

    # Use the older run to make a decision
    ...
```

You can get a lot more metadata within a step as well, something
we'll learn in more detail in the
[advanced docs](../../advanced-guide/pipelines/step-metadata.md).
