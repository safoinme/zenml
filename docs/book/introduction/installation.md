# Installation & Setup

## Welcome

Your first step is to install **ZenML**, which comes bundled as a good old `pip` package.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that we only support Python >= 3.7 <3.9, so please adjust your pip accordingly.
{% endhint %}

## Virtual Environment

We highly encourage you to install **ZenML** in a virtual environment. We like to use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage our Python virtual environments.

## Install with pip

When you're set with your environment, run:

```bash
pip install zenml
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re feeling brave, feel free to install the bleeding edge: **NOTE:** Do so at your own risk; no guarantees given!

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git@main --upgrade
```

Once the installation is completed, you can check whether the installation was successful through:

### Bash

```bash
zenml version
```

### Python

```python
import zenml
print(zenml.__version__)
```

If you would like to learn more about the current release, please visit our[PyPi package page.](https://pypi.org/project/zenml)

## Running with Docker

`zenml` is available as a docker image hosted publicly on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml). Use the following command to get started in a bash environment with `zenml` available:

```
docker run -it zenmldocker/zenml /bin/bash
```

## Enabling auto-completion on the CLI

For Bash, add this to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
eval "$(_ZENML_COMPLETE=source_bash zenml)"
```

For Zsh, add this to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(_ZENML_COMPLETE=source_zsh zenml)"
```

For Fish, add this to `~/.config/fish/completions/foo-bar.fish`:

```bash
eval (env _ZENML_COMPLETE=source_fish zenml)
```
