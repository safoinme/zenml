description: How to deploy your models and serve real-time predictions
---

Model Deployment is the process of making a machine learning model available to 
make predictions and decisions on real world data. Getting predictions from 
trained models can be done in different ways depending on the use-case, a batch
prediction is used to generate prediction for a large amount of data at once, 
while a real-time prediction is used to generate predictions for a single data
point at a time.

Model deployers are stack components responsible for serving models on a 
real-time or batch basis.

Online serving is the process of hosting and loading machine-learning models 
as part of a managed web service and providing access to the models through 
an API endpoint like HTTP or GRPC. Once deployed, model inference can be 
triggered at any time, and you can send inference requests to the model 
through the web service's API and receive fast, low-latency responses.

Batch inference or offline inference is the process of making a machine 
learning model make predictions on a batch observations. This is useful for 
generating predictions for a large amount of data at once. The predictions are 
usually stored as files or in a database for end users or business applications.

## When to use it?

The model deployers are optional components in the ZenML stack. They are used to
deploy machine learning models to a target environment either a development 
(local) or a production (Kubernetes), the model deployers are mainly used to 
deploy models for real time inference use cases. With the model deployers and 
other stack components, you can build pipelines that are continuously trained 
and deployed to a production.

### Model Deployers Flavors

ZenML comes with a `local` MLflow model deployer which is a simple model 
deployer that deploys models to a local MLflow server. Additional model 
deployers that can be used to deploy models on production environments are 
provided by integrations:

| Model Deployer                       | Flavor   | Integration   | Notes                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MLflow](./mlflow.md)                | `mlflow` | `mlflow`      | Deploys ML Model locally                                                     |
| [Seldon Core](./seldon.md)           | `seldon` | `seldon Core` | Built on top of Kubernetes to deploy models for production grade environment |
| [KServe](./kserve.md)                | `kserve` | `kserve`      | Kubernetes based model deployment framework                                  |
| [Custom Implementation](./custom.md) | _custom_ |               | Extend the Artifact Store abstraction and provide your own implementation    |

{% hint style="info" %}
Every model deployer may have different attributes that must be configured in 
order to interact with the model serving tool, framework or platform (e.g. 
hostnames, URLs, references to credentials, other client related configuration 
parameters). The following example shows the configuration of the MLflow 
and Seldon Core model deployers:

```shell
# Configure MLflow model deployer
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow

# Configure Seldon Core model deployer
zenml model-deployer register seldon --flavor=seldon \
--kubernetes_context=zenml-eks --kubernetes_namespace=zenml-workloads \
--base_url=http://abb84c444c7804aa98fc8c097896479d-377673393.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
...
```
{% endhint %}

### The role Model Deployer plays in a ZenML Stack

1. Holds all the stack related configuration attributes required to
   interact with the remote model serving tool, service or platform (e.g.
   hostnames, URLs, references to credentials, other client related
   configuration parameters). The following are examples of configuring the
   MLflow
   and Seldon Core Model Deployers and registering them as a Stack component:

    ```bash
    zenml integration install mlflow
    zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow
    zenml stack register local_with_mlflow -m default -a default -o default -d mlflow --set
    ```

    ```bash
    zenml integration install seldon
    zenml model-deployer register seldon --flavor=seldon \
    --kubernetes_context=zenml-eks --kubernetes_namespace=zenml-workloads \
    --base_url=http://abb84c444c7804aa98fc8c097896479d-377673393.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    ...
    zenml stack register seldon_stack -m default -a aws -o default -d seldon
    ```

2. Implements the continuous deployment logic necessary to deploy models
   in a way that updates an existing model server that is already serving a
   previous version of the same model instead of creating a new model server
   for every new model version. Every model server that the Model Deployer
   provisions externally to deploy a model is represented internally as a
   `Service` object that may be accessed for visibility and control over
   a single model deployment. This functionality can be consumed directly
   from ZenML pipeline steps, but it can also be used outside the pipeline
   to deploy ad-hoc models. The following code is an example of using the
   Seldon Core Model Deployer to deploy a model inside a ZenML pipeline step:

    ```python
    from zenml.artifacts import ModelArtifact
    from zenml.environment import Environment
    from zenml.integrations.seldon.model_deployers import SeldonModelDeployer
    from zenml.integrations.seldon.services.seldon_deployment import (
      SeldonDeploymentConfig,
      SeldonDeploymentService,
    )
    from zenml.steps import (
      STEP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME,
      StepContext,
      step,
    )
    
    @step(enable_cache=True)
    def seldon_model_deployer_step(
      context: StepContext,
      model: ModelArtifact,
    ) -> SeldonDeploymentService:
      model_deployer = SeldonModelDeployer.get_active_model_deployer()
    
      # get pipeline name, step name and run id
      step_env = Environment()[STEP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME]
    
      service_config=SeldonDeploymentConfig(
          model_uri=model.uri,
          model_name="my-model",
          replicas=1,
          implementation="TENSORFLOW_SERVER",
          secret_name="seldon-secret",
          pipeline_name = step_env.pipeline_name,
          pipeline_run_id = step_env.pipeline_run_id,
          pipeline_step_name = step_env.step_name,
      )
    
      service = model_deployer.deploy_model(
          service_config, replace=True, timeout=300
      )
    
      print(
          f"Seldon deployment service started and reachable at:\n"
          f"    {service.prediction_url}\n"
      )
    
      return service
    ```

3. Acts as a registry for all Services that represent remote
   model servers. External model deployment servers can be listed and filtered
   using
   a variety of criteria, such as the name of the model or the names of the
   pipeline and step
   that was used to deploy the model. The Service objects returned by the Model
   Deployer
   can be used to interact with the remote model server, e.g. to get the
   operational
   status of a model server, the prediction URI that it exposes, or to stop or
   delete a model server:

    ```python
   from zenml.integrations.seldon.model_deployers import SeldonModelDeployer
    
    model_deployer = SeldonModelDeployer.get_active_model_deployer()
    services = model_deployer.find_model_server(
        pipeline_name="continuous-deployment-pipeline",
        pipeline_step_name="seldon_model_deployer_step",
        model_name="my-model",
    )
    if services:
        if services[0].is_running:
            print(
                f"Seldon deployment service started and reachable at:\n"
                f"    {services[0].prediction_url}\n"
            )
        elif services[0].is_failed:
            print(
                f"Seldon deployment service is in a failure state. "
                f"The last error message was: {services[0].status.last_error}"
            )
        else:
            print(f"Seldon deployment service is not running")
    
            # start the service
            services[0].start(timeout=100)
    
        # delete the service
        model_deployer.delete_service(services[0].uuid, timeout=100, force=False)
    ```

### Custom pre-processing and post-processing

**Pre-processing** is the process of transforming the data before it is passed 
to the machine learning model.

**Post-processing** is the process of transforming the data after it is 
returned from the machine learning model, and before it is returned to the user.

Both pre- and post-processing are very essential for the model deployment 
process. Most models require specific input formats which requires transforming 
the data before it is passed to the model and after it is returned from the 
model. ZenML allows you to define your own pre- and post-processing in two ways:

1. At the pipeline level by defining custom steps before and after the predict 
step in the ZenML pipeline.
2. At the model deployment tool level by defining a custom predict, pre- and 
post-processing functions that would be wrapped in a Docker container and 
executed on the model deployment server.

{% hint style="info" %}
The custom model deployment support is available only for the following 
integrations:

* [KServe Custom Predictor](./kserve.md#custom-model-deployment)
* [Seldon Core Custom Python Model](./seldon.md#custom-model-deployment)

### How to Interact with model deployer after deployment?

When a Model Deployer is part of the active ZenML Stack, it is also possible to
interact with it from the CLI to list, start, stop or delete the model servers
that is manages:

```

$ zenml model-deployer models delete 8cbe671b-9fce-4394-a051-68e001f92765
```

Services can be passed through steps like any other object, and used to interact
with the external systems that they represent:

```python
from zenml.steps import step

@step
def my_step(my_service: MyService) -> ...:
    if not my_service.is_running:
        my_service.start()  # starts service
    my_service.stop()  # stops service
```

The ZenML integrations that provide Model Deployer stack components also include
standard pipeline steps that can directly be inserted into any pipeline to 
achieve a continuous model deployment workflow. These steps take care of all 
the aspects of continuously deploying models to an external server and saving 
the Service configuration into the Artifact Store, where they can be loaded 
at a later time and re-create the initial conditions used to serve a particular 
model.
