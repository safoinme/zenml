description: How to develop a custom annotator
---

Annotators are a stack component that enables the use of data annotation as part
of your ZenML stack and pipelines. You can use the associated CLI command to
launch annotation, configure your datasets and get stats on how many labeled
tasks you have ready for use.

**Base abstraction in progress!**

We are actively working on the base abstraction for the annotators, which 
will be available soon. As a result, their extension is not possible at the 
moment. If you would like to use an annotator in your stack, please check 
the list of already available feature stores down below.
