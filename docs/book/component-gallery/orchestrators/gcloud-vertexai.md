description: How to orchestrate pipelines with Vertex AI
---

The Vertex orchestrator is an [orchestrator](./orchestrators.md) flavor provided
with the ZenML `gcp` integration that uses [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)
to run your pipelines.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This component is only meant to be used within the context of [remote ZenML deployment scenario](../../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md). Usage with a local ZenML deployment may lead to unexpected behavior!
{% endhint %}

## When to use it

You should use the Vertex orchestrator if:
* you're already using GCP.
* you're looking for a proven production-grade orchestrator.
* you're looking for a UI in which you can track your pipeline runs.
* you're looking for a managed solution for running your pipelines.
* you're looking for a serverless solution for running your pipelines.

## How to deploy it

In order to use a Vertex AI orchestrator, you need to first deploy [ZenML to the cloud](../../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md). It would be recommended to deploy ZenML in the same Google Cloud project as where the Vertex infrastructure is deployed, but it is not necessary to do so. You must ensure that you are [connected to the remote ZenML server](../../starter-guide/collaborate/zenml-deployment.md) before using this stack component.

The only other thing necessary to use the ZenML Vertex orchestrator is enabling Vertex relevant APIs on the Google Cloud project.

In order to quickly enable APIs, and create other resources necessary for to use this integration, you can also consider using the [Vertex AI stack recipe](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks/tree/main/vertex-ai), which helps you set up the infrastructure with one click.

## How to use it

To use the Vertex orchestrator, we need:

* The ZenML `gcp` integration installed. If you haven't done so, run 
    ```shell
    zenml integration install gcp
    ```
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed.
* A [remote artifact store](../artifact-stores/artifact-stores.md) as part of 
your stack.
* A [remote container registry](../container-registries/container-registries.md) 
as part of your stack.
* The GCP project ID and location in which you want to run your Vertex 
AI pipelines.

We can then register the orchestrator and use it in our active stack:
```shell
zenml orchestrator register <NAME> \
    --flavor=vertex \
    --project=<PROJECT_ID> \
    --location=<GCP_LOCATION>

# Add the orchestrator to the active stack
zenml stack update -o <NAME>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
ZenML will build a Docker image called `<CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI>/zenml:<PIPELINE_NAME>`
which includes your code and use it to run your pipeline steps in Vertex AI. 
Check out [this page](../../advanced-guide/pipelines/containerization.md)
if you want to learn more about how ZenML builds these images and
how you can customize them.
{% endhint %}

You can now run any ZenML pipeline using the Vertex orchestrator:
```shell
python file_that_runs_a_zenml_pipeline.py
```

### Additional configuration

For additional configuration of the Vertex orchestrator, you can pass
`VertexOrchestratorSettings` which allows you to configure the following attributes:

* `pod_settings`: Node selectors, affinity and tolerations to apply to the Kubernetes Pods running
your pipline. These can be either specified using the Kubernetes model objects or as dictionaries.

```python
from zenml.integrations.gcp.flavors.vertex_orchestrator_flavor import VertexOrchestratorSettings
from kubernetes.client.models import V1Toleration


vertex_settings = VertexOrchestratorSettings(
    pod_settings={
        "affinity": {
            "nodeAffinity": {
                "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": {
                    "nodeSelectorTerms": [
                        {
                            "matchExpressions": [
                                {
                                    "key": "node.kubernetes.io/name",
                                    "operator": "In",
                                    "values": ["my_powerful_node_group"],
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        "tolerations": [
            V1Toleration(
                key="node.kubernetes.io/name",
                operator="Equal",
                value="",
                effect="NoSchedule"
            )
        ]
    }
)

@pipeline(
    settings={
        "orchestrator.vertex": vertex_settings
    }
)
  ...
```

A concrete example of using the Vertex orchestrator can be found 
[here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/vertex_ai_orchestration).

For more information and a full list of configurable attributes of the Vertex 
orchestrator, check out the [API Docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/latest/api_docs/integration_code_docs/integrations-gcp/#zenml.integrations.gcp.orchestrators.vertex_orchestrator.VertexOrchestrator).

### Enabling CUDA for GPU-backed hardware

Note that if you wish to use this orchestrator to run steps on a GPU, you will
need to follow [the instructions on this page](../../advanced-guide/pipelines/gpu-hardware.md) to ensure that it works. It
requires adding some extra settings customization and is essential to enable
CUDA for the GPU to give its full acceleration.
