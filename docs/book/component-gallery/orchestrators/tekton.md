description: How to orchestrate pipelines with Tekton
---

The Tekton orchestrator is an [orchestrator](./orchestrators.md) flavor 
provided with the ZenML `tekton` integration that uses [Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/) 
to run your pipelines.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This component is only meant to be used within the context of [remote ZenML deployment scenario](../../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md). Usage with a local ZenML deployment may lead to unexpected behavior!
{% endhint %}

## When to use it

You should use the Tekton orchestrator if:

* you're looking for a proven production-grade orchestrator.
* you're looking for a UI in which you can track your pipeline runs.
* you're already using Kubernetes or are not afraid of setting up and 
maintaining a Kubernetes cluster.
* you're willing to deploy and maintain Tekton Pipelines on your cluster.

## How to deploy it

You'll first need to set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy Tekton Pipelines:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="AWS" %}

* A remote ZenML server. See the [deployment guide](../../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md) for more information.
* Have an existing
  AWS [EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html)
  set up.
* Make sure you have the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) set up.
* Download and [install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) `kubectl`
  and [configure](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-cluster-connection/)
  it to talk to your EKS cluster using the following command:

  ```powershell
  aws eks --region REGION update-kubeconfig --name CLUSTER_NAME
  ```
* [Install](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/install/)
  Tekton Pipelines onto your cluster.
  {% endtab %}

{% tab title="GCP" %}

* A remote ZenML server. See the [deployment guide](../../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md) for more information.
* Have an existing
  GCP [GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)
  set up.
* Make sure you have the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk) set up first.
* Download and [install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) `kubectl`
  and [configure](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl)
  it to talk to your GKE cluster using the following command:

  ```powershell
  gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME
  ```
* [Install](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/install/)
  Tekton Pipelines onto your cluster.
  {% endtab %}

{% tab title="Azure" %}

* A remote ZenML server. See the [deployment guide](../../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md) for more information.
* Have an
  existing [AKS cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/kubernetes-service/#documentation)
  set up.
* Make sure you have the [`az` CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) set up first.
* Download and [install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) `kubectl` and
  it to talk to your AKS cluster using the following command:

  ```powershell
  az aks get-credentials --resource-group RESOURCE_GROUP --name CLUSTER_NAME
  ```
* [Install](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/install/)
  Tekton Pipelines onto your cluster.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If one or more of the deployments are not in the `Running` state, try increasing
the number of nodes in your cluster.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
ZenML has only been tested with Tekton Pipelines >=0.38.3 and may not work with 
previous versions.
{% endhint %}

## How to use it

To use the Tekton orchestrator, we need:
* The ZenML `tekton` integration installed. If you haven't done so, run 
    ```shell
    zenml integration install tekton -y
    ```
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed.
* Tekton pipelines deployed on a remote cluster. See the [deployment section](#how-to-deploy-it) 
for more information.
* The name of your Kubernetes context which points to your remote cluster. 
Run `kubectl config get-contexts` to see a list of available contexts.
* A [remote artifact store](../artifact-stores/artifact-stores.md) as part of 
your stack.
* A [remote container registry](../container-registries/container-registries.md) 
as part of your stack.

We can then register the orchestrator and use it in our active stack:

```shell
zenml orchestrator register <NAME> \
    --flavor=tekton \
    --kubernetes_context=<KUBERNETES_CONTEXT>

# Add the orchestrator to the active stack
zenml stack update -o <NAME>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
ZenML will build a Docker image called `<CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI>/zenml:<PIPELINE_NAME>`
which includes your code and use it to run your pipeline steps in Tekton. Check 
out [this page](../../advanced-guide/pipelines/containerization.md) if you want 
to learn more about how ZenML builds these images and how you can customize 
them.
{% endhint %}

Once the orchestrator is part of the active stack, we need to run 
`zenml stack up` before running any pipelines. This command forwards a port, so 
you can view the Tekton UI in your browser.

You can now run any ZenML pipeline using the Tekton orchestrator:
```shell
python file_that_runs_a_zenml_pipeline.py
```

### Additional configuration

For additional configuration of the Tekton orchestrator, you can pass
`TektonOrchestratorSettings` which allows you to configure the following attributes:

* `pod_settings`: Node selectors, affinity and tolerations to apply to the Kubernetes Pods running
your pipline. These can be either specified using the Kubernetes model objects or as dictionaries.

```python
from zenml.integrations.tekton.flavors.tekton_orchestrator_flavor import TektonOrchestratorSettings
from kubernetes.client.models import V1Toleration


tekton_settings = TektonOrchestratorSettings(
    pod_settings={
        "affinity": {
            "nodeAffinity": {
                "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": {
                    "nodeSelectorTerms": [
                        {
                            "matchExpressions": [
                                {
                                    "key": "node.kubernetes.io/name",
                                    "operator": "In",
                                    "values": ["my_powerful_node_group"],
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        "tolerations": [
            V1Toleration(
                key="node.kubernetes.io/name",
                operator="Equal",
                value="",
                effect="NoSchedule"
            )
        ]
    }
)

@pipeline(
    settings={
        "orchestrator.tekton": tekton_settings
    }
)
  ...
```

A concrete example of using the Tekton orchestrator can be found 
[here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/tekton_pipelines_orchestration).

For more information and a full list of configurable attributes of the Tekton 
orchestrator, check out the [API Docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/latest/api_docs/integration_code_docs/integrations-tekton/#zenml.integrations.tekton.orchestrators.tekton_orchestrator.TektonOrchestrator).

### Enabling CUDA for GPU-backed hardware

Note that if you wish to use this orchestrator to run steps on a GPU, you will
need to follow [the instructions on this page](../../advanced-guide/pipelines/gpu-hardware.md) to ensure that it works. It
requires adding some extra settings customization and is essential to enable
CUDA for the GPU to give its full acceleration.
