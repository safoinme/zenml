ZenML deployments often involve multiple environments. This guide helps you manage dependencies and configurations across these environments.

Here is a visual overview of the different environments:

## Client Environment

The client environment is where the ZenML pipelines are _started_, i.e., where you call the pipeline function (typically in a `run.py` script). There are different types of client environments:

* A local development environment
* A CI runner in production.
* A `runner` image orchestrated by the ZenML server to start pipelines.

In all the environments, you should use your preferred package manager (e.g., `pip` or `poetry`) to manage dependencies. Ensure you install the ZenML package and any required [integrations](../../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/component-guide.md).

The client environment typically follows these key steps when starting a pipeline:

1. Generating an intermediate pipeline representation.
2. Creating or triggering [pipeline and step build environments](environment-management.md#image-builder-environment) if running remotely.
3. Triggering a run in the [orchestrator](../../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/orchestrators/orchestrators.md).

## ZenML Server Environment

The ZenML server environment is a FastAPI application managing pipelines and metadata. It includes the ZenML Dashboard and is accessed when you [deploy ZenML](../../../deploying-zenml/zenml-self-hosted/zenml-self-hosted.md). To manage dependencies, install them during [ZenML deployment](../../../deploying-zenml/zenml-self-hosted/zenml-self-hosted.md), but only if you have custom integrations, as most are built-in.

## Execution Environments

When running locally, there is no real concept of a `execution` environment as the client, server, and execution environment are all the same. However, when running a pipeline remotely, ZenML needs to transfer your code and environment over to the remote [orchestrator](../../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/orchestrators/orchestrators.md). In order to achieve this, ZenML builds docker images known as `execution environments`.

ZenML handles the Docker image configuration, creation, and pushing, starting with a [base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml) containing ZenML and Python, then adding pipeline dependencies. To manage the Docker image configuration, follow the steps in the [containerize your pipeline](containerize-your-pipeline.md) guide, including specifying additional pip dependencies, using a custom parent image, and customizing the build process.

The execution environments do not need to be built each time a pipeline is run - you can [reuse builds from previous runs to save time](containerize-your-pipeline.md#reuse-docker-image-builds-from-previous-runs).

## Image Builder Environment

By default, execution environments are created locally in the [client environment](environment-management.md#client-environment) using the local Docker client. However, this requires Docker installation and permissions. ZenML offers [image builders](../../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/image-builders/image-builders.md), a special [stack component](../../starter-guide/understand-stacks.md), allowing users to build and push docker images in a different specialized _image builder environment_.

Note that even if you don't configure an image builder in your stack, ZenML still uses the [local image builder](../../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/image-builders/local.md) to retain consistency across all builds. In this case, the image builder environment is the same as the client environment.
