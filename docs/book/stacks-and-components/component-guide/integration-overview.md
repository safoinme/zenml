# Integration overview

Categorizing the MLOps stack is a good way to write abstractions
for an MLOps pipeline and standardize your processes. But ZenML goes further and also provides concrete implementations
of these categories by **integrating** with various tools for each category. Once code is organized into a ZenML
pipeline, you can supercharge your ML workflows with the best-in-class solutions from various MLOps areas.

For example, you can orchestrate your ML pipeline workflows using [Airflow](orchestrators/airflow.md)
or [Kubeflow](orchestrators/kubeflow.md), track experiments using [MLflow Tracking](experiment-trackers/mlflow.md)
or [Weights & Biases](experiment-trackers/wandb.md), and transition seamlessly from a
local [MLflow deployment](model-deployers/mlflow.md) to a deployed model on Kubernetes
using [Seldon Core](model-deployers/seldon.md).

There are lots of moving parts for all the MLOps tooling and infrastructure you require for ML in production and ZenML
brings them all together and enables you to manage them in one place. This also allows you to delay the decision of
which MLOps tool to use in your stack as you have no vendor lock-in with ZenML and can easily switch out tools as soon
as your requirements change.

## Available integrations

We have a [dedicated webpage](https://zenml.io/integrations) that indexes all supported ZenML integrations and their
categories.

Another easy way of seeing a list of integrations is to see the list of directories in
the [integrations directory](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/src/zenml/integrations) on our GitHub.

## Installing ZenML integrations

Before you can use integrations, you first need to install them using `zenml integration install`, e.g., you can
install [Kubeflow](orchestrators/kubeflow.md), [MLflow Tracking](experiment-trackers/mlflow.md),
and [Seldon Core](model-deployers/seldon.md), using:

```
zenml integration install kubeflow mlflow seldon -y
```

Under the hood, this simply installs the preferred versions of all integrations using pip, i.e., it executes in a
sub-process call:

```
pip install kubeflow==<PREFERRED_VERSION> mlflow==<PREFERRED_VERSION> seldon==<PREFERRED_VERSION>
```

{% hint style="info" %}

* The `-y` flag confirms all `pip install` commands without asking you for

You can run `zenml integration --help` to see a full list of CLI commands that ZenML provides for interacting with
integrations.
{% endhint %}

Note, that you can also install your dependencies directly, but please note that there is no guarantee that ZenML
internals with work with any arbitrary version of any external library.

## Upgrade ZenML integrations

You can upgrade all integrations to their latest possible version using:

```bash
zenml integration upgrade mlflow pytorch -y
```

{% hint style="info" %}

* The `-y` flag confirms all `pip install --upgrade` commands without asking you for confirmation.
* If no integrations are specified, all installed integrations will be upgraded.
  {% endhint %}

## Help us with integrations!

There are countless tools in the ML / MLOps field. We have made an initial prioritization of which tools to support with
integrations that are visible on our public [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap).

We also welcome community contributions. Check our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [External Integration Guide](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/src/zenml/integrations/README.md) for more 
details on how to best contribute to new integrations.
